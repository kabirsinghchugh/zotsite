We characterize equilibria as a function of the language available to the sender.

The language is simple if an informed sender can either fully disclose the state or nothing.

The language is rich if he can disclose any closed interval containing the true state.

Overall, our work suggests that the design of language is key in situations where disclosure is voluntary.

With a rich language, an informed sender who would like to reveal the state has several options to do so.

If the receiver may take messages at face value, 123 Simple versus rich language in disclosure games it is advantageous to use selective disclosure as it induces a higher guess from a naive receiver than full disclosure.

Formally, we show that the threshold state is lower with the rich language than with the simple one.

Overall, the language available affects both the equilibrium threshold and the messages used to reveal information above it.

A lower threshold implies that a strategic receiver learns the state more often, so he gets a higher equilibrium payoff under the rich language.

In contrast, a naive receiver always prefers the simple language: even if a lower threshold implies that fewer states are not disclosed, selective disclosure is used above the threshold when the language is rich.

The same is true for a sender informed of a low state, who uses no disclosure with both languages.

While previous works have usually questioned the necessity of mandatory disclosure policies, our results suggest that the design of language might be key when disclosure is voluntary.

In practice, a language can be called rich in markets where selective information disclosure can be freely chosen by the seller.

In contrast, a language can be called simple in environments where a seller who decides to disclose information is then forced to include a complete and standardized description.

First, as expected, a government intervention forcing a seller to use a simple language would successfully reduce seller's biases towards selective disclosure and therefore protect unwary consumers.

Finally, our result that an informed sender prefers the rich language when the state is high and the simple one when the state is low suggests that markets providing a richer and more flexible environment for information disclosure would attract higher quality sellers.

In particular, Dye and Jung and Kwon consider a proportion of uninformed senders and the simple language scenario, and identify similar threshold equilibria to the ones we describe.

Allowing for a rich language, they characterize which states are disclosed and which are not as a function of the state-dependent conflict of interest between the sender and the receiver.

Considering the rich language scenario, they already point out that naive receivers push senders to use selective disclosure.

In all these experiments however, the language considered is simple.

123 Simple versus rich language in disclosure games to determine the action of the receiver after no disclosure and the threshold ts∗ used by the sender.

5 Comparing simple and rich languages Table 1 summarizes the informed sender's equilibrium strategies.

To compare the equilibrium welfare of the different types of sender and receiver as a function of the language, we start by ordering the thresholds ts∗ and tr∗.

Proposition 3 The threshold under which the informed sender withholds information is lower when the language is rich than when it is simple: tr∗ ts∗.

123 Simple versus rich language in disclosure games Proposition 4 For every t, a strategic receiver prefers the rich to the simple language while a naive receiver prefers the simple to the rich language.

For every t, an uninformed sender prefers the simple to the rich language.

There exists t˜ such that an informed sender prefers the rich to the simple language when t \> t˜ and prefers the simple to the rich language when t < t˜. The ex-ante expected payoff of an informed sender is higher with the rich than with the simple language.

Proof Since tr∗ < ts∗ , a strategic receiver gets a finer partition of the informed sender's information when the language is rich than when it is simple.

So an uninformed sender, who has no other option than disclosing T , prefers the simple to the rich language.

An informed sender who is of type t < tr∗ discloses T with both languages, so he also prefers the simple to the rich language.

An informed sender of type t \> ts∗ fully reveals his type to a strategic receiver with both languages.

123 J. Hagenbach, F. Koessler Combined with the previous result that an uninformed sender prefers the simple to the rich language, this implies that an informed sender must prefer the rich language to the simple language.

On the one hand, the rich language leads to fewer types withholding information, which is why strategic receivers prefer it.

Clearly, the language affects several dimensions of information disclosure, and they do not matter the same way for all kinds of players.

Precisely, the language available to the sender affects how much information is revealed in equilibrium, and different kinds of players do not agree on the language they prefer.

The design of language is a novel issue and raises a different question than the one asking when mandatory disclosure is the appropriate way to reduce information asymmetries.

From an applied perspective, the choice between rich and simple languages could in fact be interpreted as a choice to implement or not a clause of conditional full disclosure.

If the clause is mandated, then the language is simple.

The authors find severe efficiency losses on coordination of actions when the language is private information, even if the language is in fact sufficient to attain efficiency.

Like in our setting, the amount of information revealed in equilibrium depends not only on the conflicts of interest but also on the language available.
