One key prediction of perfectly competitive labor markets is the "Law of one wage," which holds that there should be a single market wage for a given quality of worker.

The starting hourly wage among six restaurants surveyed, located within a circle of one-mile radius, ranged from $5.15 up to $6.00, with a mean wage of $5.78.

For a more formal illustration of wage dispersion, we consider the hourly wages of teenagers from the U.S. Current Population Survey for 1998 -2000.

If wages are set purely according to productivity, then high-wage workers and low-wage workers will have little reason to quit jobs at different rates; after all, the high-wage worker will just be moving to another job where high productivity leads to high wages, and the low-wage worker to another job where low productivity leads to low wages.

A large established literature on the impact of wages on separation rates finds that higher wages, ceteris paribus, lead to lower quit rates.

The fourth row includes one more control variable, for length 158 Journal of Economic Perspectives Table 1 Estimates of the Elasticity of Separations with Respect to the Wage PSID NLSY BHPS LFS 0.21 0.55 0.19 0.058 no controls ⫺0.944 ⫺0.515 ⫺0.798 ⫺0.646 with controls ⫺0.973 ⫺0.536 ⫺0.720 ⫺0.500 tenure controls ⫺0.575 ⫺0.340 ⫺0.503 ⫺0.343 mean separation rate Notes: This table reports the elasticities of separations with respect to the wage with standard errors in parentheses.

The elasticity of the quit rate with respect to the wage is then given by the coefficient on the log wage.

Because one can always suggest factors that are difficult or impossible to observe or measure, it is difficult to rule out all alternative hypotheses and thus prove conclusively the existence of wage dispersion for similar workers.

A fair reading of the evidence suggests that wage dispersion among similar workers is a real phenomenon.

The wage increase will not be as great as the rise in firm 1's wages.

Figure 3 graphs each firm's optimal wage, as a function of the wage offered by its competitor-this is also sometimes called a firm's "Reaction function." R 0 maps firm 0's optimal wage as a best response to wages offered by firm 1.

R 1 maps firm 1's optimal wage to wages offered by firm 0.

5 More generally, the labor supply of a firm may depend on all rival wages, some subset of them or some aggregate measure of them, such as the mean of rival wages.

Employers have good reasons to try to wage discriminate by offering higher wages to more choosy workers because of the wedge between the marginal revenue product of the worker and the wage.

In Figure 1, firm 0 could profit by offering higher wages to those workers who are located further away than x\*, while not altering the wage offered to its existing workers.

Wage Dispersion In a competitive labor market, employer characteristics should be irrelevant in the determination of wages, once one has adequately controlled for labor quality and nonwage aspects of the job.

As mentioned earlier, there is considerable evidence that wages show consistent, significant differences across employers.

Larger, more productive employers consistently pay higher wages, as do employers in certain industries.

Let us return to our two-firm example, and suppose that the firms differ in their level of productivity so that, at every level of employment, firm 0's marginal revenue product is lower than firm 1's. Hence, workers are less valuable for firm 0 than for firm 1, and its optimal wage, as a function of its rival's wage will be smaller than firm 1's optimal wage.

In equilibrium, firm 0 will set the lower wage and also have a smaller payroll than firm 1, although competition between the firms makes the wage differential smaller than the productivity differential.

Since the employer size wage effect is a positive relationship between a price and a quantity, one of the first hypotheses labor economists should consider is that it represents an upward-sloping labor supply curve to individual establishments.

Firm 1's optimal wage, as a function of firm 0's offered wage, will not differ between white and black workers; that is, its reaction function is identical for Oligopsony and Monopsonistic Competition in Labor Markets 167 both types of workers.

This insight implies that there is little incentive for a profit-maximizing entrepreneur to buy out the discriminatory firm 0 -a profit maximizer in place of firm 0 would drive up the wages of black workers in both firms, reducing both their profits!8 Minimum Wages In a competitive labor market where workers are paid their marginal product, a minimum wage set above the market wage causes employment to fall-workers whose marginal products fall below the minimum wage will be let go.

The discussion of minimum wages in any introductory course in economics concludes that a minimum wage must reduce employment.

In the labor market, the argument is that a price floor like a minimum wage can prevent a profit-maximizing monopsonist from reducing the quantity of labor hired and cutting the wage as much as it desires.

Without a minimum wage, the equilibrium wage and employment are shown by w i and L i in Figure 4.

Despite the reduction in establishment level labor supply, a minimum wage set moderately above the market wage still causes establishment-level employment to increase, because if all employers offer higher wages, the labor participation rate must also rise.

The general conclusion that one should draw is therefore that a minimum wage set moderately above the market wage may have a positive effect or a negative effect on employment, but the size of this effect will generally be small because of the two countervailing forces.

Under perfect competition, marginal revenue equals the wage, so that employment must fall with a minimum wage until marginal revenue rises to equal the new wage.

Under monopsony, a small enough rise in the minimum wage must raise employment.

Studies of employer-size wage effects do not make much attempt to deal with the fact that, in the theory of imperfect competition in labor markets, both wages and employment are simultaneously determined by the employers' choice of a profit-maximizing combination of employment and wage.

As an instrument for the level of demand, he uses measures of the hospital caseload, like in-patient days and length of stay.12 With this approach, Sullivan estimates the wage elasticity of labor supply to be 1.26 in the short run by estimating the relationship between changes in wages and changes in employment over a year.

The implied gap between the wage and marginal product is not enormous, but it is, for example, comparable in size to estimates of the union wage markup in the United States.

Their estimate of the short-run wage elasticity of labor supply is quite low, around 0.1, and they conclude that hospitals have a significant degree of wage setting power in the market for nurses.

Second, initial wages in VA hospitals were low relative to the prevailing level of market wages for nurses.

The elasticity of employment with respect to wages may then be decomposed as the elasticity of recruits with respect to wages minus the elasticity of separations with respect to wages.

An upper bound for the overall wage elasticity is then 5, which, using the formula in footnote 4, predicts that wages are 17 percent below marginal products-a finding not far from that implied by Sullivan's long-run estimate.

The primary advantage of this approach is that it leads to a more natural view of the workings of labor markets and can readily explain apparently anomalous empirical findings, like the existence of wage dispersion, why employers pay for general training, why wages are related to employer characteristics and the impact of minimum wages on employment.
