The existing literature on credence goods has not considered the possibility that some consumers have the expertise to assess the product's quality and the possibility that the producer can advertise.

'Credence goods' were first mentioned by Darby and Karni, when they said that credence qualities are expensive to judge even after the purchase.

In short, if a product is a credence good, it is costly for non-experts to assess the real value or quality of the product even after they purchase and use it.

One characteristic of these papers is that it was assumed that all consumers were non-experts who would never figure out the quality of the product even after using it repeatedly.

52 The Manchester School We assume that there are two types of consumers: x of the consumers are 'informed', in the sense that they have the expertise or skills to judge the quality of the product even before using it, while the rest, 1 \- x, are 'uninformed' and unable to tell the quality even after they use it.

On the producer side, the quality of the product is exogenously given.

We shall assume that the marginal cost is zero regardless of the quality, and denote advertising costs by c, which the producer can choose.

First, we construct a separating equilibrium, where the high quality producer sets a high price and advertises, and the low quality producer sets a low price and does not advertise.

Let p L(b, p, c) denote the profit from the low quality product when the uninformed consumers believe that the quality is high with a probability of b and the producer sets the price and advertising cost at p and c respectively.

Let p H(b, p, c) denote the profit from a high quality product.

Of course, the belief b will be decided by p, c. One obvious fact here is that at any equilibrium the producer will not set the price lower than uL. In addition, as soon as we consider a separating equilibrium, we can see that the price will be p \= uL if the product has a low quality.

No consumer will pay more than uL once they know that it is of low quality, and the low quality product will not be advertised in a separating equilibrium.

Even though the producer can choose the price, it is difficult to signal the product's quality only by the price.

The reason for this is that the low quality producer has the same marginal cost as the high quality producer, and the low quality producer has the incentive to imitate the high quality producer's price if it is high.

Of course, the high quality producer would want to set a price near uH if possible, and something other than the price, such as the advertising cost c, would be a great help in signalling quality.

Usually, price cannot be an effective quality signal when the costs are the same regardless of the quality.

Advertising of Credence Goods 53 \- x)N, the low quality producer will never try to pretend to be the high quality producer.

If c(p) \> N, the high quality producer can increase its profit by decreasing c slightly and setting it at c \- e \- N \> e \> 0), while the low quality one cannot do better than p L(0, uL, 0) by setting \- e).

According to Lemma 1, at the separating equilibrium we can expect to see advertising at the level c \= N =N \- uHxN, if the product is of a high quality.

54 The Manchester School sumers are uninformed, the low quality producer can gain a lot of profit once it is recognized as a high quality producer.

There needs to be very expensive signalling to prevent the low quality producer from imitating the high quality producer.

Lemma 2: In any equilibrium which survives the intuitive criterion, the high quality producer sets the price at p \= uH. Proof: First, for a given p a low quality producer would not choose an advertisement level c(p) \> N in any equilibrium, because this will result in a profit less than p L(0, uL, 0). Second, given that the low quality producer will not set c(p) \> N, a high quality producer will not set c(p) \> N in any equilibrium, as we saw in Lemma 1.

The high quality producer can increase its profit by xNe by using this new price and advertising cost, if the consumers believe that it is a high quality producer with probability one.

Proposition 1: There exists a unique equilibrium which survives the intuitive criterion, and it is the separating equilibrium where a high quality producer sets p \= uH and c \= N, and a low quality producer sets p \= uL and c \= 0.

Because a low quality producer cannot sell its product at a positive price in a separating equilibrium, the advertising level would be c \= uH(1 \- x)N in the separating equilibrium.

2 A S W To see how advertising affects social welfare, we will compare the separating equilibrium in Section 1, where the high quality producer always advertises, with other equilibria where no advertising is available.

Because uL is bigger than the marginal cost, the social optimum can be achieved when the product is purchased by all the consumers whether it has a high quality or not.

UL p1 < p2 < uH, and the informed consumers always buy a high quality product at p2 but never buy a low quality product at p2.

If the low quality producer is indifferent between setting its price at p1 and at p2, while no informed consumers buy at p2, the high quality producer cannot be indifferent between these two prices while selling to all the informed consumers at p2.

If we consider the intuitive criterion, another restriction on the price is p xuH. The high quality producer can get the profit of xuH at any time by setting the price at p \= uH and selling only to informed consumers.

In the separating equilibrium the low quality producer will set pL \= uL. If xuH \> uL, there can be an equilibrium where the high quality producer sets pH \= uH and sells only to informed consumers.

If the high quality producer sets pH \= uL/(1 \- x) instead of pH \= uH, the low quality one has no incentive to imitate and the profit will be higher than xuH. In this case of xuH uL/(1 \- x), the social welfare loss will be f(1 \- x)uHN, and it is definitely more than the loss when advertising is available, f N. Now consider the separating equilibrium when xuH < uL/(1 \- x).

The high quality producer's price should be low enough so that the low quality one has no incentive to imitate it.

If there is a price that is set only by the low quality producer, it will be pL \= uL. Because the low quality producer should be indifferent between p\* and pL \= uL, we have p\* \= uL/(1 \- x).

Another possible hybrid equilibrium is the case where the low quality producer sets only one price at p\* uL/(1 \- x), and the high quality producer is setting at pH \= uH as well as at p\*.

Of course, there is a probability 1 \- f that the producer will not discover this technology and has to produce low quality products anyway.

The uninformed consumers cannot tell either if the producer has found the technology or if it has invested in the technology to increase the product's quality.

58 The Manchester School between the high and low quality producers cannot be larger thanN, N and x2uHN. Let us define Dp max N, and see the next proposition.

If advertising is available, the only possible equilibrium is the separating equilibrium in which the high quality producer's profit is at a maximum among the separating equilibria, which means that the profit difference between the high quality producer and the low quality one is the largest in this equilibrium.

A producer is more inclined to pay the sunk cost and accept the technology when it can obtain a higher profit from producing high quality products.
