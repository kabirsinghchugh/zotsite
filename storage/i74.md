# Attention Manipulation and Information Overload

Competitive information supply from ﬁrms competing for attention can reduce consumers' knowledge by causing information overload. A single ﬁrm subjected to a disclosure mandate may deliberately induce such information overload to obfuscate ﬁnancially relevant information or engage in product complexiﬁcation to bound consumers' ﬁnancial literacy.

The ﬁrst part of the paper shows that, in the presence of attention manipulation, competitive information supply from ﬁrms competing for attention can reduce consumer knowledge by causing information overload. In the second part of the paper I show that a single information provider, such as a ﬁrm mandated to disclose information, may deliberately induce information overload to conceal information.

Communication is a moral-hazard-in-team problem: the more attention the DM pays to the expert and the greater the expert's effort, the more likely it is that information is exchanged successfully between them.

Each of these issue-relevant information exchanges is a moral-hazard-in-team's problem and the DM now faces a multitasking problem because she must divide her limited attention between the various experts.

The analysis in the 'single expert' setting picks up on the information overload result from the 'multiple experts' setting and shows that a single expert Downloaded from https://www.

Speciﬁcally, in the 'multiple experts' setting, information overload resulted from various experts' competition for attention.

Sometimes the expert cannot or may not withhold such information.

Attention manipulation and information overload 83 communication, information and disclosure; it may call for intervention in product design.

In contrast, Milgrom and Roberts and Gentzkow and Kamenica study multiple experts in a hard information setting, and Chakraborty and Harbaugh study soft communication between a DM and one expert on several topics.

Endogenize information acquisition in a hard information setting with multiple experts and show that adding more experts can reduce the DM's welfare.

The mechanism driving this result - that adding experts reduces each expert's incentive to acquire costly information - is distinct from information overload. In my setting, there is no information acquisition; instead, central to my ﬁnding that more information can reduce a DM's knowledge is that experts manipulate not only the substance of communication, but also the DM's attention allocation.

4 2 Soft information can be misrepresented at no cost; hard information can be withheld but not misrepresented.

For each action, the vested expert can provide information and the DM can devote attention to processing this information.

The ~i. The expert himself knows neither DM can learn the realization of x ~  ~ whether xi x or xi x nor whether the information he provides will help the DM ﬁnd out.

His information may persuade the ~i x . DM to take Ai even though αi < α*, since the DM may ﬁnd out that x ~ i is given by p(si, ri), where si and ri are, The probability that the DM learns x respectively, the expert's effort to communicate about Ai and the attention that the DM devotes to learning about Ai. Assumption.

The formulation encompasses communication technologies with the property p(0, ri) 0: even if an expert makes no effort to transmit information to the DM, it is possible for her to ﬁnd the relevant information by herself.

If α1 α*, α2 > α*, her problem is  1 pð s 1 ; r 1 2 x  ð1  α2 Þx  pðs2 ; 1  r2 Þð1  α2 Þxg max fx r1 ∈½0;1 In the unique equilibrium, expert 1 exerts effort, expert 2 is passive and the DM communicates with expert 1 about A1 and devotes some attention to acquiring information about A2. The distinction between one-sided and two-sided communication arises endogenously.

Speciﬁcally, at cost qS > 0, an expert can send a cue that contains hard information about the quality of his action.

Information overload As would be expected, when the cost of entry decreases, the supply of experts - and hence the number of actions from which the DM can choose - increases.

Information overload. A movement from right to left on the x-axis represents a decrease in the cost of entry, qS. As qS decreases, the DM ﬁrst beneﬁts from an expansion in information supply.

Alternative assumptions If I instead assume that the DM cannot observe that a cue was sent unless she incurs a cost to read it, the economic insights remain: she must open exactly two cues so long as only high-quality experts enter; then, she must either open exactly two cues but rely on information of lower quality or open more than two cues on average to identify two high-quality experts.

Externalities as the driving force of information overload The immediate cause of information overload is that the quality of proposed actions decreases with the quantity; actions worthy of deliberation become the proverbial needle in a haystack.

2017.10 Attention manipulation and information overload 93 Information overload in practice With recent advances in information technology, individuals face massive data via more channels and on more platforms.

In the presence of information overload, such an abundance of information can be counterproductive.

The main concern is that an escalating quantity of information comes with a decline in average quality and that this inverse relationship between amount and relevance makes it harder to ﬁnd 'good' information.

Explored how the quality of consumption decisions depends on 'information load', measured as the number of brands as well as the amount of information per brand provided.

A companion paper, they further showed that the subjects spent less time on processing information - or, in their words, 'tuned out' - once the information load exceeded a certain threshold.

2017.10 94 PETRA PERSSON information science corroborate the notion that more information can impair cognitive processes and decisions.

Because information overload is a driving force behind innovations in communication and information management, it is connected to recent research on choice architecture; that is, how the presentation of choices affects decisions.

A single expert and strategic attention manipulation In the previous section, we saw that crowding out and information overload result from the strategic interaction between multiple experts, each of whom try to persuade the DM to take one distinct action.

So the expected x XNR ~ N R  ð1=NR x  ð1  Þx, where payoff from A is Eðx αi. 1 Similar to before, absent more information, the DM takes A in the deliberation  > α x=ð stage if and only if x  xÞ. Or, put differently, if the DM can  α* and an opt-out obtain more information, she uses an opt-in rule if  > α*. rule if In addition to the NR components of the action A that are relevant to the action's payoff, there exist additional N∅ components of A that are irrelevant to the DM's payoff.

The expert wants to withhold the relevant information.

In the previous section, information overload resulted from various experts' competition for attention.

2017.10 Attention manipulation and information overload 97 information overload in the DM when he is subjected to a disclosure provision that mandates drawing the DM's attention to the ﬁnancially relevant aspect of the action.

Intuitively, the expert is afraid that the DM, by paying attention to the relevant topic, might discover unfavorable information about the action and opt out.

2017.10 98 PETRA PERSSON Note that the issue was not only that the 'inconvenient' information was at times unavailable, it was also that, even when provided, it was made available in a way that made it costly to locate the relevant information; that is, in a way that induced strategic information overload in the customer.

In 2008, the website This Is Money cited a warning by the British consumer and competition authority, the Ofﬁce of Fair Trading, that: providers can add to the problem knowing that consumers cannot process complex information They can create 'noise' by increasing the quantity and complexity of information, which makes it difﬁcult for consumers to see the real price.

As v 0, the expert sets N ∞, and the DM's expected utility falls to Eðx As v 0, the expert increases N such that more relevant information escapes the DM's attention, given that she can deliberate on only a limited number of components.

While complexity of information has a simple legislative recipe mandating that ﬁrms provide easy-to-understand information, complexiﬁcation is much harder to address from a legislative perspective.

Moreover, a single ﬁrm subjected to a disclosure mandate may deliberately induce information overload to obfuscate ﬁnancially relevant information or engage in product complexiﬁcation to bound consumer ﬁnancial literacy.
