Simulacra and Spectacle. »

November 15, 2011 // 0

BAUDRILLARD says that in post modern culture our society has become so reliant on models and maps that we have lost all contact with the real world that preceded the map. »  
Reality itself has begun merely to imitate the model, which now precedes and determines the real world. » Specifically “The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. » It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—that engenders the territory”  
It’s important to note however that Baudrillard is not just suggesting that postmodern culture is artificial, because the concept of artificiality still requires some sense of reality from which this artificiality comes from. »  
This artificial reality is sometimes referred to as hyper reality. »  
I believe his main point is that we have lost all ability to make sense of the distinction between nature and artifice, so in simple terms can’t even tell what’s real and what’s fake anymore. »  
In the first order of simulacra, which he associates with the pre-modern period, the image is a clear counterfeit of the real; the image is obviously recognized as just an illusion, a place marker for the real. »  
in the second order of simulacra, which Baudrillard associates with the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, the distinctions between the image and the representation begin to break down because of mass production and the proliferation of copies. » Such production misrepresents and masks an underlying reality by imitating it so well, thus threatening to replace it in the third order of simulacra, which is associated with the postmodern age, we are confronted with a precession of simulacra; that is, the representation precedes and determines the real. » There is no longer any distinction between reality and its representation; only a simulation. »  
My example of this would be the fashion and beauty industry. » Magazines have almost re-created the definition of beauty with heavily photoshopped images and perfect models. »  
Initially we might understand that this idea of beauty isn’t actually real and is artificial, but eventually we become bombarded with so many images and ideas that we might actually start to define ‘beauty’ by what we see in magazines etc.  
Debord's aim and proposal with his ideas in The Society of The Spectacle, was “to wake up the spectator who has been drugged by spectacular images. »  
In terms of simulacra, this connection can be seen – as Baudrillard says that we as people have lost our ability to differentiate between reality and artifice, in other words – we have been drugged by spectacular images and can no longer see what is real, only a representation of what is real. »  
Both spectacle and simulacra appear to used by those in power whom wish to keep us distanced from reality, from knowing the truth as such. » Another example I thought of regarding this was how the history of war is written only by the winners. »  
In his first chapter of The Society of the Spectacle, The Culmination of Separation Debord says that  the spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can never be questioned. » Its sole message is: “What appears is good; what is good appears. » ” The passive acceptance it demands is already effectively imposed by its monopoly of appearances, its manner of appearing without allowing any reply. »  
Again, this ‘passive acceptance’ of the spectacle fits in with Baudrillards ideas, we sometimes just accept simulacra without realising it’s reality and we need to wake up to this. »  
Marx's theory of alienation refers to the separation of things that naturally belong together, or to put antagonism between things that are properly in harmony. » In particular, it refers to the social alienation of people from aspects of their “human nature”. » Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. »  
Capitalism links to the idea of commodity fetishism. » In simple terms, this means capitalism affects the way people interact with each other based on the economic class they belong to and the means by which this is reflected are commodities. »  
For instance, under capitalism everything that can be exchanged becomes a commodity, even labour. »

Alienation and Commodity Fetishism in relation to Simulacra

Baudrillard says that capitalism and exchange value are two of the key phenomenon in the loss of distinction between “reality” and the simulacrum. »

He says

And: It is capital that now defines our identities. » We thus continue to lose touch with the material fact of the laborer, who is increasingly invisible to a consumer oriented towards retail outlets or the even more impersonal Internet. » A common example of this is the fact that most consumers do not know how the products they consume are related to real-life things. »  How many people could identify the actual plant from which is derived the coffee bean? Starbucks, by contrast, increasingly defines our urban realities  
So to conclude, it is a combination of fetish commodity and capitalism that has led to this increased level of simulacra, representation of items and reality has taken over from the ‘real', or atleast we can no longer see which is which. »  
Debord, G. The Society of the Spectacle http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order\_simulacra http://www.marxists.org/subject/alienation/index.htm http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/baudrillardsimulation.html http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/baudrillard1.htm

Occupiers actions as part of the spectacle

With Debord implying that the spectacle has won and that we are all trapped in inauthentic lives with the real power hidden from all of us then surly that implies that anti-globalisation or anti-capitalist groups are just a part of the spectacle. »  
For these groups to be part of the spectacle is damming to them as that is what they are fighting against but they could be, completely unknowingly, be a part of it. »  
If we believe Baudrillards idea that ‘simulation is the current stage of the simularcrum’ and that in today’s society there is no such thing as a reality then these groups really can’t make a difference because they are part of a system that exists based on maps and models and has lost all concept of reality outside of them. »  
His argument for Multinational capitalism is ‘As the things we use are increasingly the product of complex industrial processes, we lose touch with the underlying reality of the goods we consume. » Not even national identity functions in a world of multinational corporations. » According to Baudrillard, it is capital that now defines our identities. » ’ Meaning that we are judged and judge others by their value in terms of money. » We gauge our time on how much it is worth to us and try to put a value on everything. » For groups that go against this system they will surly get left behind of swept up in it. » The only way for an anti-capiltist group to succeed would be for everyone to stand against it and that is very unlikely. »  
In terms of being part of the spectacle, I believe they are. » For example, the Occupations that are taking part have so far achieved nothing and the people in power hardly seem to be paying any attention to them, that is because an overwhelming majority of people are quite happy living the way we do. »  
We look upon them and take an interest to what’s going on but never get directly involved, we don’t experience the ‘reality’ of being a part of it and this brings me back to Baudrillards point that we live a lot of things through simulation i.e. » watching in on the TV. » Even things like wars can operated from behind the radar or tv screen, removing the need for the reality of hand-to-hand fighting. »
