You can also get started with our\nuseful starter theme [https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter/], which includes the\nmost common foundations and components required to build your own theme.\n\n> If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a themes section on our public Ghost forum\n[https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes].","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2020-06-28T14:46:53.000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T20:37:28.000Z","published_at":"2020-06-28T14:46:53.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme designed for publishers which can easily be adapted for most purposes, or you can build a custom theme to suit your needs.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ef8ad5d99fabb000178d2ed","uuid":"60fce06f-9f47-496e-b846-f44c8edfaa1b","title":"Apps & integrations","slug":"apps-integrations","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-icons.png\",\"cardWidth\":\"full\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<script src=\\\"https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&container=true&limit=8\\\"></script>\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-and-webhooks-in-ghost.png\",\"alt\":\"Screenshot of custom integrations with webhooks in Ghost Admin\",\"cardWidth\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://zapier.com\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/docs/api/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/themes/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Work with your existing tools\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to connect your Ghost site to hundreds of the most popular apps and tools using integrations that take no more than a few minutes to setup.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Whether you need to automate workflows, connect your email list, build a community or embed products from your ecommerce store, our \"],[0,[0],1,\"integrations library\"],[0,[],0,\" has got it all covered with hundreds of tutorials.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"On top of this, you can connect your Ghost site to more than 1,000 external services using the official integration with \"],[0,[1],1,\"Zapier\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[2],1,\"Example\"],[0,[],0,\": When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2],1,\"Here are the most popular Ghost<>Zapier automation templates:\"],[0,[],0,\" \"]]],[10,1],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Custom integrations\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"At the heart of Ghost sits a robust JSON API – designed to create, manage and retrieve content with ease. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to create custom Ghost integrations with dedicated API keys and webhooks from the Integrations page within Ghost Admin. \"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Beyond that, the API allows you to build entirely custom publishing apps.

THought contains possibiklity of State of affairs which it thinks.\n 5. Thus what is thinkable is imaginable and is possible, though can be\n    true/false. One can't think of impossibilities, that is contradictions.\n 6. A thought is true a priori when its possibil;ity itself guarantees its\n    truth, that is, a thought such as free will is known be true or cartyesian\n    by the virtue of its existenmce.\n 7. Thoughts are expressed vai propositions through perceptory senses sound and\n    writing.\n 8. \n\nPropositions\n 1.  Sensible if derived from other true propositions.\n 2.  Propositions are in projective relation to the world. They contain the\n     projection not the p[rojected.\n 3.  THat is to say the possibility of the projected, not itself.\n 4.  The content of the proposition is that of the significant(which signifies),\n     to repeat, in the proposition, the form of its sense contained, not the\n     content.\n 5.  aRb does not imply a stands in relation to b where a and b are objects. it\n     implies \"a\" stands in relation to \"b\" where a, b are names.\n 6.  When the constituent of proposition changed to a variable then we get a\n     class of propositions. if all constituents of a compount proposition\n     changedm we still have a class of propositions.\n 7.  thus p1p2p3 to xyz, then xyz is corresponding to a logical form, with\n     values p1,p2,p3\n 8.  p1,p2,p3 here are expressions of the proposition p, the general form of xyz\n     which take the symbols p1,p2,p3, then the determined values p1p2p3, the\n     essence lies in the description of symbols, and asserts nothing of the\n     symbolized(explain)\n 9.  thus propositions is a function of symbols/expressions contained in it.\n 10. thus in logical syntax, the proposition cannot talk about itself. This is\n     because the propositional; sign cannot be contained in itself - theory of\n     types\n 11. that is to say a function cannot be its own argument F(F(x)) here since F\n     but one outer one inner they have different meanings and hence redundant.\n     Thee F kletter by itself signifies nothing. then if F(F(x)) and F(F(F(x)))\n     here one is \\(\\phi(F(x))\\) and other is \\(\\psi(\\phi(F(x))\\)\n 12. thus we can write the resolution of russells paradox as \\[F(F(u)) :\n     (\\exists\\phi:F(\\phi u).\\phi u = Fu\\]\n 13. Propositions have accidental and essential features, the former is how\n     particular signs make it up where as the latter expresses its sense. The\n     particular configuration that is to say unimportant but the possibility of\n     every possible is revealing of Reality.\n 14. Propositions have a sense independent from facts. Say if that were not the\n     case, then T/F relations exist between signs too. p signifies T !p\n     signifies F, such that understandiung by the way of !p(negative teaching)\n     is completely valid. But this cannot be so since p is T if it asserts the\n     case where \"p\" = !p[is the case]then !p is T[ !p is tyhe case] and we have\n     a contradiction.\n 15. This is to say that p and !p can assert the same assertion only means that\n     the not operator ! is not in reality. Negation doesn't add to the sense of\n     proposition such that !(!p) = p. p and !p have opposite senses but\n     coreespond to the same reality.\n 16. For example a black spot on a white page where each pixel takes a 0 to 1\n     value indicating black or white, the point here is that cfor any pixel to\n     have a black or white value, it first needs to be known under what\n     conditions is it judged as either Black or white. In a random pixel, even\n     where there exist T/F values but not the judgment conditions,c the\n     proposition is rendered without sense as they coresspond to nothing.\n 17. This is to say that \"The present king of france is bald\" cannot be taken at\n     false value since there is no present king of france so that it can neither\n     be judged T or F whil;e in logic which is not rid of colloqial elements has\n     this problem and incorrectly judged as false. Thus for a proposition to\n     exist it must have sense. It's possibility stems from thabt, and hence\n     sense precedes proposition and cannot be judged a posteriori that sense or\n     senseless.\n 18. Thus !p = T is wrong as the sense is in denial, and a denying proposition\n     is logically different from a proposition denied. the proposition denied in\n     fact determines the denying proposition. Thus to deny the the denied\n     proposition are two different proposiitons.\n 19. \\(\\sum P:P==T\\) is Totality of Natural Science. Thus Philosophy cannot be a\n     natural science. Philosophy object in elucidation or clarification of\n     arguments/thoughts, and hence is an anctivity. Thus there are no\n     philosophical propositions.\n 20. Proposiitons represent Reality, cannot represent what they share in common\n     with reality. Since that is akin to the logical form which provides the\n     possibility of representation.\n 21. To represent the logical form one needs to go outside that logic, the world\n     that is to display it. A 2d plane's geometry logic can only be displayed\n     with the existence of a 3d space.\n 22. The sense of a proposition lies in its agreement(disagmt) with the\n     existence of atomic facts. The simplest propon that is asserts the\n     existence of an atomic fact. The simple propon is then just a connection of\n     names where if names x0,y0,z0 then a function of names is the simple propon\n 23. say p: a=b where = implies sign a is replaceable by b, then a and b are two\n     signs of same meaning, and are just presentations which say nothing about\n     the meanings of a and b. So say you don't know that a and b signify the\n     same object. Then do you understand the names? Of course not.\n 24. the proposition a=a is neither a simple proposition nor significant signs,\n     since a simple proposition if T implies that the atomic fact exists.\n\nSigns and symbols\n 1.  sign must be sensibly perceptible used for projecting possible state of\n     affairs\n 2.  projection here is tantamount to thinking of the sense of proposition.\n 3.  sign which carries the proposition is the propositional sign.\n 4.  definitions are primitive signs\n 5.  names are simple signs\n 6.  primitive sign signifies through signs by which it is defined.\n 7.  thus primitive signs are the named, the rest which are derived and are not\n     primitive are defined with primitive signs.\n 8.  unlike the proposition the derived sign though cannot be taken apart, the\n     primitive signs which form then are unique and independent or atomic./\n 9.  primitive signs meaning in ostentation or elucidation, what is not already\n     expressed in primitive or derived signs applied by the existents to express\n     that unexpressed.\n 10. Elucidation is a proposition of primitive signs, where the existent sigmns\n     meanings are already known.\n 11. expressions are symbols, that is signs with sense. expressions are parts of\n     propositions which characterize its meaning.\n 12. the proposition is a symbol or expression and characterizes a form and\n     content.\n 13. symbol presupposes the forms of all propositions in which it can occur.\n     that is the propositions a symbol characterizes represent that symbol in\n     their general form where in this form. the expression or symbol is contant\n     and everything else is variable.\n 14. that is a common charachteristic mark of proposiitons.\n 15. The symbol is presented as variable, which when valued are propositions\n     various which contain the sense of that symbol. that is Lt var-> constant\n     Expn = propon - this is thus a propositional variable.\n 16. 2 symbols can have a common sign, the sign is the sense perceptible part of\n     the symbol, but then those 2 signs signify differently, that is same signs\n     but different symbolisms.\n 17. Let \\(x : (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},...)\\) then the variable \\(x\\) is the sign of\n     the concept-object(objects as variables in logical symbolism). The point is\n     that the object belonging to a formal concept cannot be expressed by a\n     proposition. It is shown in the sign(name) of that object. These formal\n     concepts just like proper concepts cannot be presented by\n     functions(primitive signs analoggy). Expression of a formal concept is a\n     propositional variable. Thus the propositional variable signifies the\n     formal concept where the values the variable holds are objects under the\n     said concept.\n 18. \\(\\exists (x,y)\\) if this is used as a proper concept then arise from it\n     senseless propositions.\n 19. For example \"There are objects\" is not valid(LIKE PYTHON) \"there are books\"\n     is valid.\n 20. For example \\(\\exists y\\in Y\\) then the objectsare underlied with macros so\n     to say, the keywords in a programming language, which then cannot be used\n     as variables, as that would lead to recursion. Similar problematic uses of\n     words like compllex, facts, objects, functions, number - is a must to be\n     resolved in PL. Here these formal concepts can be treated as variables only\n     where values are taken, not as functions or classes which is error.\n 21. Thus to say 1 is a number is a senseless proposition as it is a recursion,\n     akin to saying There is only one 1 or more evidently \"2+2 at 3'o'clock is\n     equal to 4\". The senselessness in all of these aret he same, however it may\n     not be appartent in some which leads to paradoxes.\n 22. \n\nLanguage\n 1.  In colloquial language multivalued signs is prevalent, 2 symbols with same\n     signs.\n 2.  For example \"is\" - equality, existence, verb, adjective(identity)\n 3.  Colloqial confusions - applicable symbolism \"Green is green\" where proper\n     noun and adjective same sign\n 4.  In development of perspicious language such symbolism is to be avoided. The\n     symbolism needs then a logical grammar.(syntax)\n 5.  In the logical language(perscipious) symbol through use of sign where\n     unecessary signs rendeered meaningless.\n 6.  Thuys Russell's paradox is resolved that is every set which is not a member\n     of itself -\n 7.  Talking about the meanings of sign themselves that is the sign x is empty\n     but not in russell's case, in the logical syntax, a sign itself has no\n     meaning, it is only in the description of expresisons.\n 8.  The propositional sign is the thought or alternativelky the thought is\n     significant proposition.\n 9.  Language is \\(\\sum P\\)\n 10. Natural language hides within it the logic of language, just as we produce\n     sounds without knowing how we do the process via the vocal cords. Natural\n     language thus expresses sense despite the confusions within it.\n 11. Natural language like the clothes that ornament the clothed, where the body\n     parts are implicit in the cloth for that particular limb.\n 12. NL are words like Wittgenstein box which hides the thought, and hence\n     propositions in NL are prone to senselessness(not true or falsity)\n 13. What is good, or is that beautiful - an example of a pseudo philosophical\n     problem merely the problem of NL and hence a senseless assertion.\n 14. That what appear to be deep problems nothing but word play since the\n     apparent logical form from NL is not the logical form of the PL. (The\n     clothes themselves without the body)\n\nCase, States\n 1. state of affairs can be described but not named.\n 2. b\n 3. c\n\nPictures\n 1.  objects form the elements of a picture of facts\n 2.  picture of fact itself a fact.\n 3.  elements related to all other elements in a picture. This is structure.\n 4.  The possibility of this structure is the form of representation.\n 5.  There are relations which make the picture. This relations belong to the\n     picture of connection between elements and objects. This is intuition.\n 6.  PIcture is thus a snapshot/model of reality.\n 7.  picture is a fact, fact not necessarily a picture.\n 8.  fact to be a picture, the picture needs to be true in the logical space,\n     that is a correspondance between the picrture and the pictured. This\n     correspondance is the form of representation.\n 9.  Picture does not represent form, it shows it implicitly. This is because\n     picture cannot be placed outside its form of representation(to show it that\n     would be a requirement)\n 10. What is common between the reality and the picture is itself the form which\n     is implicit in the picture\n 11. A picture is a logical picture if logical form. The logical picture can\n     depict the world then. The logical form underlies the picture and pictured.\n 12. Pictures represent thus aa possible state of affairs in logical space. The\n     picture within it the possibility of state of affairs it represents.\n 13. Since logical, pictures agree or disagree with reality. A picture nedds to\n     be faithful, that is it represents the represented, which is independent of\n     T/F values\n 14. What a picture presents if faithful as its SENSE\n 15. Thus truth or false of whether sense that is if the picture independent of\n     T/F is faithful to reality, thus two sets of T/F\n 16. A true picture thus necessarily need be faithful ie sense and hence its\n     truth cannot be stated independently.\n 17. THUS there can't be a priori TRUe picture.\n 18. A picture of state of affairs is a proposition iff logically expressed.\n\nLogic,Language,Propositions\n 1.  proposition determines poition in logical space. The existence of logical\n     space guaranteed via existence of the proposition itself(form) though space\n     can be empty. Thus a proposition gives us the whole logical space\n 2.  proposition is a picture of reality.\n 3.  Example - A musical piece, say beethovens 9th symphony. We have the musical\n     sheet music or score, vinyl, cd's cassettes, 0s and 1s, analog waves,\n     phonetic signs via singing.This is akin to the relation between language\n     and the world.\n 4.  The logical structure/form is common to all of these\n     isomorphisms/manifestations. One can change among them, is like a\n     translation of language.\n 5.  Thus if a proposition is understood, being a faithful picture of reality,\n     one knows the state of affairs presented by it, here then the proposition\n     is understoiod, without having the sense of the proposition be known,c\n     thius is because the proposition itself reflects the sendse.\n 6.  A proposition expresses the what, but it doesnot express but implicitly\n     shows the how, and hence is a description of a fact - description of\n     objects being its external properties whereas description of reality being\n     the internal properties.\n 7.  in a true proposition then one can see the logical properties of reaslity,\n     this is because propositions construct a reality through logic.\n 8.  Therefore if one understands a proposition that implies if true it implies\n     what is the case, hence understanding precdes truth and falsity of the\n     proposition.\n 9.  THere are logical signs yes, but they are not representative since only\n     objects can be named, hence the logic of facts cannot be represented.\n 10. Lets suppose we have \\[x:f(x)\\]then a) Is \\(f(x)\\) general?, No, because we\n     can't answer what is generalized. b)\\(f(x_{g})\\) then there is no scope for\n     generalization. c) \\((G,G).F(G,G)\\) here we cvant determin4e the identity\n     of variable. These methods fail because they don't have the necessary\n     mathemnatical multiplicity.\n 11. thios is all to say that proposition elements and the different state of\n     affairs have the same multiplicity, but that this multiplicity cannot be\n     represented.\n 12. In Idealism spatial relations gathered through spatial spectacles, but they\n     cant exzplain the multiplicity of those spatial relations, assumes without\n     spectackles and with spectacles but those spectacles are necessarily always\n     on.\n 13. Just like the musical piece, the logical form shows itself in language,\n     cannot be isolated or made explicit.The vinyl disk with grooves is the\n     proposition with the form of that musical piece. Thus the propositions\n     exhibit the logical form of reality, so if fa propn for object a and ga\n     another propn and if fa and ga contradict one naother this is shown in the\n     structure, and what can be shown cannot be said.\n 14. The properties of these structures is then called internal property and the\n     relations as internal relations which are iumplicit.\n 15. If this internal property since by definition is unthinkable(in the thought\n     sense) then the object doesn't posess the internal property like it\n     posesses the external attributes.\n 16. To distinguish then forms via properties cannot be done as iot would assume\n     we can assert properties of forms.\n 17. Thus the internal relations between possible state of affairs express\n     themselves via internal relations the propositions presenting them.\n 18. For example a series of numbers orderedd via an internal relation or a\n     series of propositions aRb then \\(\\exists x: aRx.xRb\\) or equivalently\n     \\((x,y): aRx.xRy.yRb\\)\n 19. The logical form is anumeric, that is there ate noi numbvers in logic -\n     then to say of Monism, dualism in logical form is senseless.\n 20. Specification of all True simple propositions then describes the world. if\n     n atomic facts then kn possibilities that is \\[k_{n}= \\sum_{0}^{n} \\small\n     n\\large C\\small v ={^n}C{_0}+{^n}C{_1}+{^n}C{_2}...{^n}C{_n}\\]\n 21. Since the propositionis expression of agreement disagreement with the truth\n     possibilities, T or F coresspond to no objects, and hence there are no\n     logical objects.\n\nConstructing the Perspicious/logical language from Natural Language\n 1. Since the formal concept is given in the object which falls under the said\n    object, then one cannot introduce concept of a function as well as special\n    functions as primitive concepts(say concept of a number and definite\n    numbers)\n 2. For example - p - b is successor to a, here \\(aRb,\\exists\n    x:aRx.xRb,\\exists(x,y): aRx.xRy.yRb\\) Here we are going in a vivious circle\n    and hence it's not valid since the general term is through a variable.\n 3. This is to say this - No proposition can answer on the question of existence\n    of formal concepts - The following question is thus senseless \"Are there\n    unanalyzable propositions?\"\n 4. \n\nThe meat - Logic** Technical\nOperations\n 1. a\n\nTautologies and Contradictions\nPhilosophical Implications\n 1.

Why is it though? Am I writing for someone else, wanting someone to appreciate my complicated thought structures, appreciate the hilarity that is my life?  What my conscious self tells me is that I am an ordinary individual living an ordinary life, being a cog in the spinning wheel of the world. But it contradicts with my belief of being the most important person I know, and this battle has raged on since being an adult.</p>\\n<p>It is a rather ominous feeling, when you realize that you’re not invincible. When you see old people in their miserable state while you enjoy the bliss of youth, it passes by fast. The passions of the body wane everyone says. You don’t care. Why would you? But being the prescient being I am, complemented by the knee surgery I underwent and as a result feel shaking joints, that invincibility is all but shattered.</p>\\n<p>For long I’ve maintained a nihilistic view of existence. People say that I am too idle, since I have no job and spend my time thinking unpleasant thoughts. But do ignoring these thoughts and getting busy is the right approach? I see my grandparents fighting with such philosophies in the sunset years of their life, but at least they have their religion to fall to. Maybe I should be religious? Why deny the comforts of believing in one? I should be selfish. Would ease my stress definitely. Put everything on god. People won’t call me crazy either.</p>\\n<p>I’ve stopped dreaming. Not dreaming,dreaming, those are out my control and don’t make much sense either. But stopped dreaming of what I should be, what I can be. I do the things I love to do. I am not doing anything that I don’t want to do. Then why am I still unhappy. I don’t understand this aspect of humanity. We always indulge in what we feel like doing. We eat good food, listen to good music. We don’t do anything which would derive us unhappiness, yet we are unfulfilled. We resort to spending money or changing jobs or go on vacations. Being in a happy state of mind and having a long term satisfaction of life are two different things I guess.</p>\\n<p>On terms of talking about sexuality and relationships, I used to be rather uncomfortable talking openly or even thinking openly about those aspects of my life. It’s my fault though that I lacked certain maturity to be really open about things like fucking and love. Maybe it’s because of the environment I have grown up in. Anyway, at this point of my life, I can say this at least, I want someone. I am a person who is a man child and whose thought process isn’t very stable. That pillar of support I need from someone who is understanding, and instils stability and care for me. Is this a substitute of the role my mother carried out? Is this why I only respond positively to outspoken extrovert women, because I could blindly accept and plead them to take care of me? But I know that this isn’t very selfish, because out of my selfish needs arises a need to provide love also.</p>\\n<p>Thinking about death scares me.

Different schools of thought within\neconomics provide principles on how to reach the same goal (Economic Development\ninstead of being closer to God in this aspect) usually in complete contrast to\nthe other schools of thought.\n\nKarl Marx bellowed that Religion is the opium of the masses, But isn’t it ironic\nthat after his death he himself would be a prophet of a new religion, communism,\nwhich would ultimately shape up more than half a century in the near future?.\nHis theory was based upon contradictions, yet it proves his followers made his\nteachings contradictory in its self.\n\nIn conclusion, I affirm that to understand human decision making, it takes a\ntool so ridiculous that it fails in every attempt to do as such. A tool riddled\nwith contradictions. A tool, which as it develops makes things more complex than\nsimple. A tool that is basically human in nature. What can be more beautiful\nthan that? A tool which explains everything and nothing and creates even more\nproblems than it solves. Economics is not a religion, it is the ultimate\nphilosophy.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199747e","created_at":"2016-06-28T10:02:31.000Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T10:02:31.000Z","published_at":"2016-06-28T10:02:31.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ef993fa5c47140001997487","uuid":"aac46515-ae8b-4be5-b1cc-ce6da9254d91","title":"How Propaganda Works","slug":"how-propaganda-works","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>After careful introspection, I have come to the belief that educated folks like us, who have developed tools of skepticism and cynicism and think we are beyond the forces of propaganda today are the biggest and most vulnerable victims of it.

This force of imperialism derives its power from Philosophy of Science, of which leading figures are Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend.

Here is to be emphasized the term science, for economics aims to strive towards the epitome of true science, that is the methodology of classical physics. The fact that many models of economic theory have been derived from the physical sciences is no coincidence. Moreover, economists are imputed as having physics-envy, with matching mathematical rigor as a proxy for doing better science.</p>\\n<p>It is necessary to explore as to why and how this entails economics to have dominance and hegemony among the social sciences. Clearly, physics holds as much hegemony over the hard sciences as the United Nations has control over global peace. So what is it that the author uses the term of Economics imperialism in the social science domain? For that, a careful historical examination of the fields development and the nature of knowledge generated within the field needs to be looked into.</p>\\n<p>The author traces this history of imperialism into three phases. The first phase comes after the post-war (The second one) development of a new mathematical rigor within economics, with the ascent of what we now dub as neo- classical synthesis and more importantly, models of general equilibrium as developed by Arrow, Debreu and others. The powerful implications of the two fundamental welfare theorems resonated in the entire scientific community, with strong results derived from axioms under certain assumptions, tautologically de- rived with the help of mathematics. This methodology is called the hypothetico- deductive approach, and regarded philosophically as the ideal mode of generating new knowledge as the results derived from within it are certain(unlike probable results of the inductive approach).</p>\\n<p>In the strict Popperian sense, this made economics the most scientific of all social sciences. However, as any economist would know, this applies to only neo-classical economics, which ascribes to methodological individualism as its foundational framework (a framework developed by none other than Popper). Neo-classical economics also fits into Popper&#8217;s definition of science, as it adheres to the doctrine of falsification, more than of other competing schools of thought, as well as other social sciences in general.</p>\\n<p>However, by mid-1970s, it was apparent that the General Equilibrium model didn&#8217;t serve more than a textbook mathematical puzzle(Blaug,1992) and despite its mathematical elegance, it failed to hold any relevance for the real economy, given the nature of arbitrary assumptions. This divided the economics community into two fields in regard to the future of economic methodology. On one side were the predictionists, propounded by (Friedman,1953) for whom assumptions and descriptions were irrelevant in the face of precise predictions, and the descriptionists on the other, led by Samuelson, who argued for descriptive accuracy and gave the now famous ’F-twist’.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 3\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>This gave way to the next phase of economic methodology, dubbed by the author as the New Economics phase. The methodology of economics gravitated towards inductive and adductive methods rather than the strict hypothetico deductive approach it had earlier followed, relying on ad hoc assumptions and a piecemeal approach to economic problems rather than deriving results from the older generalized theory, resulting in varied sub-fields of economic theory ranging from international trade, industrial organization to environmental economics, addressing uniquely a plethora of questions it had yet not addressed. One of the proponents of this new approach, Gary Becker defined Economics as an approach or an engine of analysis and forayed across disciplines dealing with questions relating to crime, family, marriage and discrimination through economic theory.</p>\\n<p>The author argues that the hegemony of economics before the New Economics phase could be argued for owing to the superior deductive method com- pared to the remaining social sciences but the new imperialism was based on poorer inductive and adductive methods.1Blaug calls this fall from grace of economics as a science from the pedestal of falsification to the ditch of verificationism.</p>\\n<p>However, it has repeatedly been asserted by both philosophers and economists, that economists never really practiced falsification, but only romanticized the concept of it. What they instead practiced was Nave or innocuous falsification.(Blaug,1992).The wave of the New Economics approach left an explanatory void both theoretically and empirically and was filled by institutionalism and empiricism respectively. According to the author, the rise of empiricism and institutionalism brought with them a new wave of imperialism, but with even a lesser case for economic hegemony.</p>\\n<p>The rise of quantitative data analysis and Econometric methods have taken the field by storm in the last two decades. While the development of sophisticated methods of analyzing data has increased the power of generating inferences, but that power comes with a great responsibility and ethics. Under the force of publishing bias, an algorithmic approach of econometric tools to generate papers has eroded the reputation of empirical techniques. There is a well-known adage that under sufficient torture, the data can confess anything. Even when data quality issues are taken care of, the Kletzer Effect that is multiple interpretations from the same data, sometimes reinforcing opposing viewpoints independently.</p>\\n<p>(The case against inductive methods has been referred as to the ’Black Swan’ problem where justification of all swans are white break down when a black swan is discovered.)</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 4\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>In the domain of Popper, both institutionalism and empiricism abide by the mode of verification rather than falsification.

That is the age old debate of induction versus deduction. Now it is clear that deduction approach generates truth with certainty, but how do we account for the truth of the premises? Ultimately in this backward induction, the premise has to be derived from induction. The black swan argument against induction is too restricting to do any relevant social science in that manner. It becomes a huge cost to researchers to avoid the black swan when probably there might not be a black swan at all, and that happens more often than not. The author maintains that the new economics theoretical findings are dubious as he gives the example of trade theory and its paradoxes. But he skips over that economists learn from their mistakes and now apply more realistic environments to their modeling from strategic interaction, imperfect information, and completion and so on. Economists have moved on from comparative static based single equilibrium models in linear systems to multiple equilibrium systems with stochastic processes in a dynamic environment. Both have their pros and cons, but it would be naive to base predictions on a theory that maintains the world runs within a single equilibrium point.</p>\\n<p>The author has misjudged the nature of economic imperialism as related to its methodology. Economic questions hold tremendous importance with actual material implications for entire world population, and economic policy is what rules the world in geo-politics, questions of poverty and standard of living. The basic necessities of life of food, clothing and shelter depends on what economists do in their ivory towers. This power and influence is what gives economists what he dubs as imperialism. Imperialism as defined in the dictionary means a force- ful occupation. Economics hasnt either forced nor occupied the other social sciences. Crossing disciplinary boundaries to better answer economic questions or even attempt to answer the disciplines own pertinent question should be lauded as freedom of research rather than encroachment. Nobel Laureates in Economics boast of the names of Herbert Simon, Daniel Kahnemahn, and Elinor Ostrom among many who used their discipline to answer economic questions by refuting orthodox theories throws light on the rather accommodating nature of the field.</p>\\n<p>The final point in my response would be in respect of the entire philosophy of the movement of economics in which my central argument corresponds that appraising scientific knowledge in terms of deductivism, verificationism, essen- tialism, reductionism, and other isms does more harm than good. I explain this in the following points: &#8211;</p>\\n<p>• Appraisal of economic methodology appears to share the same fate as economics does in having different schools of thought within the tradition. The Popperian criteria of falsification is just one strand of ap- praisal. Other strands include Kuhns theory of Scientific revolutions, Lakatos paradigm of scientific research programs and Feyerabands an- archistic theory of knowledge generation. Philosophical appraisal fails in this context as Poppers falsification hypotheses are themselves not subject to falsification and hence falls under the paradigm of what he calls pseudo science.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 5\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li>Following a particular definition of science institutionalizes the generation of knowledge, which is then expropriated by vested interests. Freedom of knowledge generation might be anarchy, but the negative association of the word corresponds to political science and not academic research. If knowledge generation is institutionalized, we wont see accidental and unorthodox discoveries, which includes Newtons classical physics, Galileos experiments, Darwins Origin of Species and Einsteins theory of relativity.</li>\\n<li>Its true an anarchist model of knowledge generation would be amorphous and will have a lot of noise to signal ratio where noise denotes bad quality research and signal as quality research. But that holds better than in a system where research is filtered so that there is a lot less noise but drastic cuts in signal too. And the unregulated system of research ultimately does get recognized, in a more democratic space, if it deserves recognition.\\n<p>This is not to say that economics as a discipline is clearly in the right di- rection and doesnt need any introspection. As I earlier mentioned, the prob- lems within economics plague other social sciences and even the hard sciences. Economists have started questioning their physics-envy as can be seen from vehement criticism of DSGE models by leading economists to development of disciplines such as Cultural Economics and Neuroeconomics which some decades back would have been sheer blasphemy. The imperialism within the field has di- minished, and is integrating with other social sciences as social sciences should, in a normative sense. The future of economics is moving towards Big Data and machine learning and sticking to luddite approaches of sticking with the deduc- tivist model and not adapting to the times is what makes a field truly scieantific.

Not citing, if you have interest you can google it\nand find the paper. He basically argues that economic imperialism has come in\nwaves with different methodologies as its force, but each force with less\nconviction to be imperial. This force of imperialism derives its power from\nPhilosophy of Science, of which leading figures are Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn,\nImre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend. The response which is a basic view and needs\nto be refined further,(though still contains the point I sternly believe in) is\nas follows\n\nDemonstratio longe optima est experiential-Sir Francis Bacon (By far, the best\nproof is, experience)\n\nEconomics is the de facto queen of the Social Sciences. Here is to be emphasized\nthe term science, for economics aims to strive towards the epitome of true\nscience, that is the methodology of classical physics. The fact that many models\nof economic theory have been derived from the physical sciences is no\ncoincidence. Moreover, economists are imputed as having physics-envy, with\nmatching mathematical rigor as a proxy for doing better science.\n\nIt is necessary to explore as to why and how this entails economics to have\ndominance and hegemony among the social sciences. Clearly, physics holds as much\nhegemony over the hard sciences as the United Nations has control over global\npeace. So what is it that the author uses the term of Economics imperialism in\nthe social science domain? For that, a careful historical examination of the\nfields development and the nature of knowledge generated within the field needs\nto be looked into.\n\nThe author traces this history of imperialism into three phases. The first phase\ncomes after the post-war (The second one) development of a new mathematical\nrigor within economics, with the ascent of what we now dub as neo- classical\nsynthesis and more importantly, models of general equilibrium as developed by\nArrow, Debreu and others. The powerful implications of the two fundamental\nwelfare theorems resonated in the entire scientific community, with strong\nresults derived from axioms under certain assumptions, tautologically de- rived\nwith the help of mathematics. This methodology is called the hypothetico-\ndeductive approach, and regarded philosophically as the ideal mode of generating\nnew knowledge as the results derived from within it are certain(unlike probable\nresults of the inductive approach).\n\nIn the strict Popperian sense, this made economics the most scientific of all\nsocial sciences. However, as any economist would know, this applies to only\nneo-classical economics, which ascribes to methodological individualism as its\nfoundational framework (a framework developed by none other than Popper).\nNeo-classical economics also fits into Popper’s definition of science, as it\nadheres to the doctrine of falsification, more than of other competing schools\nof thought, as well as other social sciences in general.\n\nHowever, by mid-1970s, it was apparent that the General Equilibrium model didn’t\nserve more than a textbook mathematical puzzle(Blaug,1992) and despite its\nmathematical elegance, it failed to hold any relevance for the real economy,\ngiven the nature of arbitrary assumptions. This divided the economics community\ninto two fields in regard to the future of economic methodology. On one side\nwere the predictionists, propounded by (Friedman,1953) for whom assumptions and\ndescriptions were irrelevant in the face of precise predictions, and the\ndescriptionists on the other, led by Samuelson, who argued for descriptive\naccuracy and gave the now famous ’F-twist’.\n\n\n\nThis gave way to the next phase of economic methodology, dubbed by the author as\nthe New Economics phase. The methodology of economics gravitated towards\ninductive and adductive methods rather than the strict hypothetico deductive\napproach it had earlier followed, relying on ad hoc assumptions and a piecemeal\napproach to economic problems rather than deriving results from the older\ngeneralized theory, resulting in varied sub-fields of economic theory ranging\nfrom international trade, industrial organization to environmental economics,\naddressing uniquely a plethora of questions it had yet not addressed. One of the\nproponents of this new approach, Gary Becker defined Economics as an approach or\nan engine of analysis and forayed across disciplines dealing with questions\nrelating to crime, family, marriage and discrimination through economic theory.\n\nThe author argues that the hegemony of economics before the New Economics phase\ncould be argued for owing to the superior deductive method com- pared to the\nremaining social sciences but the new imperialism was based on poorer inductive\nand adductive methods.1Blaug calls this fall from grace of economics as a\nscience from the pedestal of falsification to the ditch of verificationism.\n\nHowever, it has repeatedly been asserted by both philosophers and economists,\nthat economists never really practiced falsification, but only romanticized the\nconcept of it. What they instead practiced was Nave or innocuous\nfalsification.(Blaug,1992).The wave of the New Economics approach left an\nexplanatory void both theoretically and empirically and was filled by\ninstitutionalism and empiricism respectively. According to the author, the rise\nof empiricism and institutionalism brought with them a new wave of imperialism,\nbut with even a lesser case for economic hegemony.\n\nThe rise of quantitative data analysis and Econometric methods have taken the\nfield by storm in the last two decades. While the development of sophisticated\nmethods of analyzing data has increased the power of generating inferences, but\nthat power comes with a great responsibility and ethics. Under the force of\npublishing bias, an algorithmic approach of econometric tools to generate papers\nhas eroded the reputation of empirical techniques. There is a well-known adage\nthat under sufficient torture, the data can confess anything. Even when data\nquality issues are taken care of, the Kletzer Effect that is multiple\ninterpretations from the same data, sometimes reinforcing opposing viewpoints\nindependently.\n\n(The case against inductive methods has been referred as to the ’Black Swan’\nproblem where justification of all swans are white break down when a black swan\nis discovered.)\n\n\n\nIn the domain of Popper, both institutionalism and empiricism abide by the mode\nof verification rather than falsification. The former seeks at pattern behavior\nwhile the latter is used to expound established worldviews.\n\nBefore getting into the merits or demerits of each approach, a fundamental\nquestion needs to be accounted for, which we have taken for granted. That is the\nage old debate of induction versus deduction. Now it is clear that deduction\napproach generates truth with certainty, but how do we account for the truth of\nthe premises? Ultimately in this backward induction, the premise has to be\nderived from induction. The black swan argument against induction is too\nrestricting to do any relevant social science in that manner. It becomes a huge\ncost to researchers to avoid the black swan when probably there might not be a\nblack swan at all, and that happens more often than not. The author maintains\nthat the new economics theoretical findings are dubious as he gives the example\nof trade theory and its paradoxes. But he skips over that economists learn from\ntheir mistakes and now apply more realistic environments to their modeling from\nstrategic interaction, imperfect information, and completion and so on.\nEconomists have moved on from comparative static based single equilibrium models\nin linear systems to multiple equilibrium systems with stochastic processes in a\ndynamic environment. Both have their pros and cons, but it would be naive to\nbase predictions on a theory that maintains the world runs within a single\nequilibrium point.\n\nThe author has misjudged the nature of economic imperialism as related to its\nmethodology. Economic questions hold tremendous importance with actual material\nimplications for entire world population, and economic policy is what rules the\nworld in geo-politics, questions of poverty and standard of living. The basic\nnecessities of life of food, clothing and shelter depends on what economists do\nin their ivory towers. This power and influence is what gives economists what he\ndubs as imperialism. Imperialism as defined in the dictionary means a force- ful\noccupation. Economics hasnt either forced nor occupied the other social\nsciences. Crossing disciplinary boundaries to better answer economic questions\nor even attempt to answer the disciplines own pertinent question should be\nlauded as freedom of research rather than encroachment. Nobel Laureates in\nEconomics boast of the names of Herbert Simon, Daniel Kahnemahn, and Elinor\nOstrom among many who used their discipline to answer economic questions by\nrefuting orthodox theories throws light on the rather accommodating nature of\nthe field.\n\nThe final point in my response would be in respect of the entire philosophy of\nthe movement of economics in which my central argument corresponds that\nappraising scientific knowledge in terms of deductivism, verificationism, essen-\ntialism, reductionism, and other isms does more harm than good. I explain this\nin the following points: –\n\n• Appraisal of economic methodology appears to share the same fate as economics\ndoes in having different schools of thought within the tradition.

The Christian ethic was partly forgotten\nthrough conception of capitalism, and the need to work.\n\nPolitical revolutions, Economic revolutions and ultimately social revolutions\nhinged on the idea of liberalism characterized the epoch, and the ‘I’ became the\nphilosophy of mankind, and nations were conceived of the identity of ‘I’, with\nmy rights, which the new states guaranteed slowly in response to evolution of\nthese institutions.\n\nFast forward to now.\n\nDespite all differentiated conceptions of sense of reality and morality, as well\nas competitions from other doctrines, individualism and its forms of egotism,\nliberalism, libertarianism have solidified and spread throughout the world,\nwhich is a fact, whether is good or bad cannot be judged.\n\nHowever, while the wheels of motions of earlier epochs are still turning, there\nhas been a metamorphosis from within, and a consciousness towards a new epoch is\nemerging.\n\nScience has outpaced thought, and has created anarchistic modes of organization\npossible within the internet, connecting everyone in the world, and providing\nthem instant access to all forms of information one needs.\n\nWith developments in fields of psychology, linguistics and neurosciences we have\nagain started asking questions, unlike the earlier epoch on the existence of a\ndivine meaning to now questioning our own understanding of meanings we gave to\nourselves. We have uncovered grossly humbling biases in our thought and\ncognition, the limits of our subjectivity and our needs and desires, which\ntranscend to almost being universal. Concepts of the collective consciousness,\ncollective unconsciousness, the genealogy of our languages to a common ancestry,\nuncovering of the knowledge that our genes reflect varied identities, pierce\nstraight to the heart of the barriers between the I and them we put through our\nnew institutions of nationalism.\n\nGlobalization has reached a point of intermingling of people in such a way, that\nthe current tension is nothing but friction of the inevitable, the breaking of\nthe barriers of the I, and recognize the we, across cultures and people. The new\nepoch is starting from the evolution of human thought in the foundation of a new\nethic- Global empathy.\n\nWe have always been bogged by selfishness from animal instincts to protect\nourselves at any costs, until religious doctrine advised the masses to care for\neach other. But a commandment is a top down order of ethics. That has been the\nwrong method of ethics all along, for global empathy comes from within, and\ntruly defines the meaning of a civilization and perhaps re-defines it. Global\nempathy in the truest meaning of the world global (or universal) will radically\nchange the politics, philosophy, and will help us go beyond ourselves, from\nthinking animals to beings with the truest conception of our world, and\nawareness of our connectedness.\n\nSome doctrines have pointed this out since ancient times, but it’s with\nexperience only that such doctrines reveal their wisdom, and the first step to\nlaunch ourselves into this new epoch is to go beyond our evolutionary pre\nprogramming of selfishness as a virtue. Of course, this can only happen over\ntime, when technology allows us to lax the seeds of competitiveness within us.\nThis includes the dissolving of the nation state, the dissolution of economic\nscarcity, and resolution of indoctrination of prejudices, which allow ourselves\nto truly understand a person and perceive no threat from him. When this is\nachieved, which I speculate is slowly creeping through our awareness, would the\nproblem of ethics resolve itself forever, and virtue will evolve on its own. The\nanarchistic tool of the Internet I speculate would be supreme in tearing down\nthe hierarchy of ethics we still take from our institutions.\n\nPerhaps this is what Nietzsche meant when he talked about the ubermensch(The\nideal man) as the opposite end to the animal which man finds himself to be\nbetween in. Perhaps this would be Nirvana and enlightenment which the Buddha\nattained. All I know is, that the wheels have been set in motion for a new\nworld, and a new humanity.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199747e","created_at":"2017-07-21T11:34:05.000Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T11:34:05.000Z","published_at":"2017-07-21T11:34:05.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199748a","uuid":"b165331b-b75d-4c5e-b4a9-4f9350835742","title":"Of Kierkegaard, Anxiety, and Selfhood","slug":"of-kierkegaard-anxiety-and-selfhood","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: These are not factually Kierkegaard’s views, but some of his conceptions on which I have built upon and offered not an interpretation, but a reinterpretation of the broad structure of his argument.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Before the advent of modern medical psychology, the ills of mind were an ailment of the soul for philosophers, but semantics defining the mind and the soul might change, the afflictions do not.

Do we think through language? or language expresses thought? How are our thoughts affected when we don&#8217;t have any concept of a language? These are some interesting and important questions, but what is obvious from the first two statements is that language can go beyond thoughts into the realm of nonsense, but we have thoughts which language can&#8217;t articulate with all its words and dictionaries. So why this dual contradiction? Let&#8217;s explore!</p>\\n<p>The first two sentences. Carefully think of each. Can you think of a colorless green vapor? It’s a logical negation. An impossibility. However, nonsensical statements are surely possible, but what picture it produces in your mind? The weight of your voice? This effect is called a language illusion, which in our ordinary lives is not so explicit. Ludwig Wittgenstein, a logician philosopher claimed that all philosophy beyond scientific statements belonged to this realm of ‘non-sense’. This doesn’t mean that Language has a one up on thoughts since it encompasses thoughts and nonsense, but there are thoughts which are outside the ambit of language as well.</p>\\n<p>Consider this thought experiment (also attributed to Wittgenstein). Suppose you have two people, each with an identical white box, and an object inside which we assume to be different, which the other can’t see. (we call the people A and B and the objects X and Y respectively) A looks at X, thinks it’s a beetle and announces that he has a ‘beetle’. The beetle in A and B’s dictionary is called Z, so the box represents Z. That means, B looks at Y, thinks it’s a beetle and announces Z, which is his identical box. Both A and B use the same box, that is the word, but here comes the interesting part. The objects X and Y can be anything, either both beetles, beetle looking wasps, or something else, which they both call beetle but can’t see the fundamental distinction between X and Y, and hence thought gains a one up on Language. So when we use words such as <em>love, justice, </em>and freedom, different forms exist in different people with some similarities, but usually more different than we presume.</p>\\n<p>What is a chair? When you picture a chair, the familiar cushioned four legged furniture item comes to mind. However, a flat rock or a flat tree trunk are chairs? So a chair is something or anything we can sit on?

In fact, that’s how I learned and internalized the concepts of diminishing returns, diminishing marginal utility, economies of scale, the laws of demand and supply et al. Of course at the time I didn’t know that such concepts fuelled a deeper purpose, of concave functions in convex sets being open to well behaved mathematical analysis. In hindsight, I do remember things which flummoxed me at the time, when I really thought, who really equates marginal revenue with marginal costs in a business? I’ve never heard of someone run a business like that! But of course, since I was an Indian student, and a fresher in Economics, I cast the thoughts away and thought well, this is how it must be and the businesses are naïve, after all, they haven’t done formal training in Economics!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>After about seven years since those days, now well settled into my Ph.D. in the subject, I have really come a long way in thinking about things. The evolution has been bumpy, and now I can say that my puberty is over regarding the field. I’d like to think it works for all students the same way. You start with your own intuitions about the field at the start. The introductory textbooks restrict your domain so that you are ashamed of your earlier ideas, and lack of confidence in saying that this theory doesn’t make any sense. I mean look at the mathematics! They must be right. It’s me who’s stupid, and we start speaking in the language of the textbooks.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>However, when this period is over if one is brave enough to consider graduate school, you start deconstructing the subject according to your own ways. After formal methods become second nature to you, you start gaining more and more confidence, until you someday are able to say. ‘The mathematics is fine. But why would someone put such conditions as to expect the answer?’. It’s kind of like driving. It just makes sense after a particular point of time, and though you still argue in your head that ‘I know nothing.’ The fact is that you do know now, and soon you’ll become that author other students would balk at.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>An interesting part here is that when this evolution takes place, the learning consists of many elements. You start appreciating as to why that author made those unintuitive assumptions. Tractability, feasibility and the application of models start making sense to you. A certain philosophical understanding accompanies the technical understanding, and as you read more and more, the jigsaw puzzle starts solving itself, and one can see that puzzle from micro specificity to at the broadest possible sense. But still, one thing remains unchanged. That curious intuitive child who questions, like he did seven years back, although now with better tools and formal methods as ammunition.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This leads me back to my example of Behavioral Economics. The first question that bothered me were certain assumptions which made no sense. So now you saw work which actually challenged those assumptions, and won a Nobel Prize for that. But it is important and liberating to know that Economics was at a time the most open field for all sorts of ideas. In fact, the first Behavioral Economist was none other than our own Mr. Adam Smith, with his somewhat lesser known title, <strong>The Theory of Moral Sentiments. </strong>Not just Smith, other intellectual titans such as F.A. Hayek, who published again a lesser known work called <strong>The Sensory Order, </strong>and another titan, John Maynard Keynes, whose lack of formal economic training meant that most of his perspectives on economic thought were intuitive. Animal Spirits, Liquidity Trap, The Beauty Contest Games, and so much more. We were all behavioral until we decided to become Scientists and not Social Scientists, which happened mostly in the second half of the twentieth century onwards.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Coming to the Nobel winning Behavioral Economist who started a new revolution. No, I’m not talking about Richard Thaler, who won this year’s prize, I am talking about a genius by the name of Herbert Simon, who won the prize in 1978, for attacking the most controversial and important assumptions Behavioral Economics owe their career to, <strong>Rationality. </strong>Any academician apart from economists will laugh at the assumption so fundamental to economic analysis that humans behave rationally in markets, at least statistically. That means, we see our lifetime’s worth of benefits from one good when buying it. That given the same option again and again over time, there is no option that we should change it. That we perfectly calculate each extra benefit from the good to each dollar paid for it. Of course, this is horseradish. We basically need this assumption to perform mathematical analysis with good continuous functions and an equilibrium point. Simon worked on what we call Bounded Rationality.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Maurice Allais worked on the consistency axiom and showed us how the framing of choices can deceive us. Vernon Smith helped develop the field of experimental economics, where microeconomic axioms could be tested under controlled settings. Alvin Roth worked on the market design, where not everything depends on prices. (Price gouging makes perfect sense to an economist, but would never be legally justified, rightly so). Kahneman and Tversky worked on Prospect Theory, that depending on the amount of reward or punishment, our valuation, and expected utility changes, and is not constant, of course, we don’t all have iron hearts!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>So far so good. These gentlemen gave us great works and deservedly got published in the top journals, and won a Nobel prize at that. But they weren’t a threat to the established industry. These analyses were great for a moment’s reflection and then getting back to work. Until the tide grew larger and larger, and Richard Thaler was one of the few forerunners of this new wave. This needs to go mainstream these forerunners thought, which had genuine scholars as well as opportunists who’ll get a wealth of new research to publish. Thaler’s work on Mental Accounting and other behavioral anomalies and collaboration with Kahneman and Tversky, and upcoming students who wanted a more psychological approach to economics struggled for almost two decades until the line of work got its own handbook, it’s own journal and its own foundation. It helped that this community was tightly knit, unlike the dispersed nature of the neoclassical school, which was divided on matters of how much should the markets be free. The Harvard-MIT intellectuals versus the Chicago School.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Behavioral Economics gained its biggest breakthrough in the financial crisis when according to me, this subfield gained the most acceptability and was much more attractive than Marxian critiques of the crises, and suddenly Behavioral Economics became the rage. Together with Behavioral Finance, which challenged the rational Efficient Market Hypothesis, the popularity of Behavioral Economics skyrocketed, and though Behavioral Economics gained the name, the popularity had its own trade-off, and one aspect shined brighter than most: &#8211; ‘Nudging’. Thaler got his own cameo in the movie ‘The Big Short’, other behavioral economists were called into policy making to make simple nudge incentives, which on accord of their own incentives they most definitely complied. Behavioral Economics as a buzzword became more and more obscure and handed an opportunity for the criticizers on a golden plate. It’s easy to see whenever a research framework clicks, opportunists jump at making all sorts of theories and predictions, just as econometrics is currently struggling. The abuse of that framework makes us ask, is it the theory at fault? No! It’s human behavior! Econometrics and Behavioral economics if done robustly are extremely useful to develop precise descriptions and predictions. It is unto the academic community and those stakeholders at peer-reviewed journals to face this monumental task of sifting through the hay to find the needle.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The future of economic theory depends much on how computing technology updates and allows us to perform trillions of calculations so that models need not be so restricted anymore. Agent-based simulations with multiple assumptions in base could be tested for innumerable parameters again and again with varied assumptions on behavior. It’s time to keep the future in mind in how economics would be done, and my wishful thinking gains confidence by the decision of the Nobel committee to recognize the role Behavioral Economics would have in the future.</p>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-106\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/10/ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009.jpg\" alt=\"ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009\" width=\"1449\" height=\"1083\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/10/ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009.jpg 1449w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/10/ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009-300x224.jpg 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/10/ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009-1024x765.jpg 1024w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/10/ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009-768x574.jpg 768w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/10/ct-nobel-prize-economics-richard-thaler-20171009-1200x897.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1449px) 100vw, 1449px\" /></p>\n<p>Prof. Richard Thaler, The Recipient of The Nobel Prize in Economics, 2017</p>\n<p>When I first started studying Economics in college, I naturally assumed that economics is behavioral.

In fact, that’s how I learned and internalized the\nconcepts of diminishing returns, diminishing marginal utility, economies of\nscale, the laws of demand and supply et al. Of course at the time I didn’t know\nthat such concepts fuelled a deeper purpose, of concave functions in convex sets\nbeing open to well behaved mathematical analysis. In hindsight, I do remember\nthings which flummoxed me at the time, when I really thought, who really equates\nmarginal revenue with marginal costs in a business? I’ve never heard of someone\nrun a business like that! But of course, since I was an Indian student, and a\nfresher in Economics, I cast the thoughts away and thought well, this is how it\nmust be and the businesses are naïve, after all, they haven’t done formal\ntraining in Economics!\n\n\n\nAfter about seven years since those days, now well settled into my Ph.D. in the\nsubject, I have really come a long way in thinking about things. The evolution\nhas been bumpy, and now I can say that my puberty is over regarding the field.\nI’d like to think it works for all students the same way. You start with your\nown intuitions about the field at the start. The introductory textbooks restrict\nyour domain so that you are ashamed of your earlier ideas, and lack of\nconfidence in saying that this theory doesn’t make any sense. I mean look at the\nmathematics! They must be right. It’s me who’s stupid, and we start speaking in\nthe language of the textbooks.\n\n\n\nHowever, when this period is over if one is brave enough to consider graduate\nschool, you start deconstructing the subject according to your own ways. After\nformal methods become second nature to you, you start gaining more and more\nconfidence, until you someday are able to say. ‘The mathematics is fine. But why\nwould someone put such conditions as to expect the answer?’. It’s kind of like\ndriving. It just makes sense after a particular point of time, and though you\nstill argue in your head that ‘I know nothing.’ The fact is that you do know\nnow, and soon you’ll become that author other students would balk at.\n\n\n\nAn interesting part here is that when this evolution takes place, the learning\nconsists of many elements. You start appreciating as to why that author made\nthose unintuitive assumptions. Tractability, feasibility and the application of\nmodels start making sense to you. A certain philosophical understanding\naccompanies the technical understanding, and as you read more and more, the\njigsaw puzzle starts solving itself, and one can see that puzzle from micro\nspecificity to at the broadest possible sense. But still, one thing remains\nunchanged. That curious intuitive child who questions, like he did seven years\nback, although now with better tools and formal methods as ammunition.\n\n\n\nThis leads me back to my example of Behavioral Economics. The first question\nthat bothered me were certain assumptions which made no sense. So now you saw\nwork which actually challenged those assumptions, and won a Nobel Prize for\nthat. But it is important and liberating to know that Economics was at a time\nthe most open field for all sorts of ideas. In fact, the first Behavioral\nEconomist was none other than our own Mr. Adam Smith, with his somewhat lesser\nknown title, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Not just Smith, other intellectual\ntitans such as F.A. Hayek, who published again a lesser known work called The\nSensory Order, and another titan, John Maynard Keynes, whose lack of formal\neconomic training meant that most of his perspectives on economic thought were\nintuitive. Animal Spirits, Liquidity Trap, The Beauty Contest Games, and so much\nmore. We were all behavioral until we decided to become Scientists and not\nSocial Scientists, which happened mostly in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury onwards.\n\n\n\nComing to the Nobel winning Behavioral Economist who started a new revolution.\nNo, I’m not talking about Richard Thaler, who won this year’s prize, I am\ntalking about a genius by the name of Herbert Simon, who won the prize in 1978,\nfor attacking the most controversial and important assumptions Behavioral\nEconomics owe their career to, Rationality. Any academician apart from\neconomists will laugh at the assumption so fundamental to economic analysis that\nhumans behave rationally in markets, at least statistically. That means, we see\nour lifetime’s worth of benefits from one good when buying it. That given the\nsame option again and again over time, there is no option that we should change\nit. That we perfectly calculate each extra benefit from the good to each dollar\npaid for it. Of course, this is horseradish. We basically need this assumption\nto perform mathematical analysis with good continuous functions and an\nequilibrium point. Simon worked on what we call Bounded Rationality.\n\n\n\nMaurice Allais worked on the consistency axiom and showed us how the framing of\nchoices can deceive us. Vernon Smith helped develop the field of experimental\neconomics, where microeconomic axioms could be tested under controlled settings.\nAlvin Roth worked on the market design, where not everything depends on prices.\n(Price gouging makes perfect sense to an economist, but would never be legally\njustified, rightly so). Kahneman and Tversky worked on Prospect Theory, that\ndepending on the amount of reward or punishment, our valuation, and expected\nutility changes, and is not constant, of course, we don’t all have iron hearts!\n\n\n\nSo far so good. These gentlemen gave us great works and deservedly got published\nin the top journals, and won a Nobel prize at that. But they weren’t a threat to\nthe established industry. These analyses were great for a moment’s reflection\nand then getting back to work. Until the tide grew larger and larger, and\nRichard Thaler was one of the few forerunners of this new wave. This needs to go\nmainstream these forerunners thought, which had genuine scholars as well as\nopportunists who’ll get a wealth of new research to publish. Thaler’s work on\nMental Accounting and other behavioral anomalies and collaboration with Kahneman\nand Tversky, and upcoming students who wanted a more psychological approach to\neconomics struggled for almost two decades until the line of work got its own\nhandbook, it’s own journal and its own foundation. It helped that this community\nwas tightly knit, unlike the dispersed nature of the neoclassical school, which\nwas divided on matters of how much should the markets be free. The Harvard-MIT\nintellectuals versus the Chicago School.\n\n\n\nBehavioral Economics gained its biggest breakthrough in the financial crisis\nwhen according to me, this subfield gained the most acceptability and was much\nmore attractive than Marxian critiques of the crises, and suddenly Behavioral\nEconomics became the rage.

Even among audiophiles, this judgment is present, and more strongly so, as the snobs will themselves consider many within the community to be audio-fools rather than audiophiles, regressing the irony further.</p>\\n<p>So what is an audiophile? And what is my part in all of this? And why am I bothering the readers with an introduction to this niche community?</p>\\n<p>An Audiophile, in the truest sense, is someone who enjoys or is obsessed with accurate sound reproduction, mostly applied to the music industry. The simple point is that in the process of production of music to consumption of it, we tend to miss out on details either from induced noise and distortion, poor equipment, compression, and so on. This post is an entry to this strange world so that anyone can benefit from the wisdom of the community with the least amount of foolery. I consider myself an audiophile simply because of my love of music, and I don’t mind spending at least some money more than average to enjoy one of the great joys of life. I have spent months going through various audiophile communities, and I can say enough to give my opinion which might help you understand the rationality and the irrationality of the community.</p>\\n<p><strong>Disclosure: The world of Audiophiles is a slippery slope, and one can simply fall into the cycle of getting more equipment than needed, and this is not an exaggeration. So I suggest not going very deep into it, unless you are a music producer, or have lakhs of rupees to spend.</strong></p>\\n<p>So let’s start with the basics, which starts with the physics of sound. The sound is generated by the rapid compression and decompression of air molecules, which have a frequency. This vibration takes the form of a wave. Our voice to the drums to strings of a guitar and all instruments work on this principle. The sound wave reaches our ear-drums or a microphone, which vibrates accordingly to the compressions of air, producing electric signals, leading to our perception of the sound. The average human ear can hear frequencies from 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz.</p>\\n<h1><strong>The Source</strong></h1>\\n<p>In the studio, the music produced is picked up by high-quality microphones, and electrically stored as .wav files, and recorded into various storage devices such as the vinyl or cassette in analog form. These .wav files are raw files and usually are suited for studio mixing and remastering since each wave file can be massive, and unpractical for portable use.</p>\\n<p>The analog wave is then converted into a digital format and compressed using various technologies. The most popular one is, of course, the mp3 file, which is an example of lossy compression. The basic point is that the algorithm for an mp3 file simply cuts out all frequencies below and beyond the human range, and masks out other, usually inaudible or barely audible sounds to present a file of magnitudes of smaller size. The mp3 files also differ in the amount of information cut from the original file, and while the ubiquitous 128 kbps is fine for streaming services, the 320 kbps is larger and more applicable for critical listening.</p>\\n<p>Audiophiles usually prefer the analog reproduction though if possible, that is the vinyl, or the DVD of an album, for digital music, they prefer lossless conversion formats such as .flac files, which are much larger than an mp3 file but retains all of the subsonic and supersonic frequencies.</p>\\n<p><strong>Verdict #1 – I suggest that if one doesn’t have high fidelity audio equipment, and just wants to do some casual listening then low bit rate mp3s are fine. But I highly suggest that for critical listening and using good audio equipment, 320 kbps mp3 files and FLAC files are a must, at least for the albums you really love, and the classics such as Kind of Blue by Miles Davis or The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. I would expand a bit more on this when I come to equipment.</strong><strong> </strong></p>\\n<h1><strong>The Reproduction</strong><strong> </strong></h1>\\n<p>The next part is the reverse. Now we need to convert the digital files stored on your smartphone or laptop to your equipment. I will focus on headphones for this post since they offer the highest fidelity in the least amount of money and convenience. The vinyl or the DVDs usually have to be used with a hi-fi stereo system, which I might do in another post. There are three parts to reproduction.</p>\\n<p><strong>Digital to Analog conversion – </strong>Speakers are reverse microphones. They receive electric signals and a diaphragm vibrates, compressing the air and producing sound. It’s obvious that your speakers don’t read 0s and 1s as what your computer stores the files as. All smartphones and laptops have a built-in DAC, called a Digital to Analog converter. In India, we simply call them sound cards. Now though your onboard DAC is usually good enough for casual listening, when listening to high-quality files with high-quality equipment, we can run into some trouble.</p>\\n<p>A really good headphone can pick up frequency ranges a lot larger than our hearing capability. Coupled with a good quality source file, a lesser quality DAC will reproduce signals which would have induced noise and distortion, which would be easily picked up by your headphones, hampering your experience. The point is that in the analog to digital conversion by studios, it is obvious they use the highest quality equipment to prevent noise and distortion, but the reproduction of the reverse is our responsibility to bear. However, this is contentious because the modern day onboard DACs are improving in quality so that external DAC which are cheaper might go redundant. So unless you have really good headphones, the DAC can be thought about over time, depending on your satisfaction with the music.</p>\\n<h1><strong>Headphones </strong></h1>\\n<p>Coming to the most important part of the audiophile discussion. Let’s start with the basics of types of Headphones. I’m going to assume that the fit is of the over the ears variety which offers the best in terms of comfort and quality, with portability being the trade-off. But before that, we need to go through some basic terminologies used in the world of head-fi.</p>\\n<p><strong>Open vs Closed –</strong> Open back headphones have ear cups which are covered by grills on the outer side, which effectively means that your headphones are no longer isolated from the outside world. This means that not only will the sound of your headphones leak outside, but you won’t be insulated from the outside environment at all. Closed back headphones are fully covered on the outside, providing the necessary isolation.</p>\\n<p>So why would anyone buy open backed headphones? Well, they are open for a reason. The openness of the cans gives you an airy and a more natural feel towards the music. It provides scope for a much larger soundstage as if one is hearing to the music live. The closed back as is obvious, provides isolation, doesn’t disturb others, and is usually stated to have scope for a larger bass response than the open cans.</p>\\n<p><strong>Sound Signature – </strong>Every headphone sounds different, but for an audiophile, it is imperative to know what the difference is, and what the music should really sound like. Now it is known that most cheap earphones and some branded <strong>cough</strong> Beats <strong>cough</strong> headphones are geared towards bass. Audiophiles have two issues regarding this. It is not that Audiophiles don’t love their bass, but the bass from cheap quality sets is what is called a muddy bass, or uncontrolled bass. Audiophiles love the tightness in their music, and a controlled bass even though less in magnitude, is high in quality. The second is that Audiophiles by definition, want a neutral sound signature. The easiest way to visualize this is that each headphone has its own adjusted Equalizer settings, which one can’t change. This invisible equalizer is the sound signature. When the equalizer is flat or off, we deem it as neutral, which many of us might know can seem boring to the untrained, but over time, one extracts a purer sound, just as the artists wanted us to hear it. Audiophiles though are not always interested in listening to music critically or analytically, pointing out each individual notes, and hence there are also V-shaped signature phones, which means an elevated bass and treble response, which is more fatiguing to the ear but much more fun.</p>\\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Driver Technology – </strong>There are three technologies through which sound is reproduced. The most popular ones mostly in all headphones below Rs. 30,000 are dynamic drivers. There is also a planar magnetic technology, which is heavy and offers much warmer and powerful bass response, and at the highest levels are electrostatic headphones, which use capacitive technology and need extremely high voltages to drive them.</p>\\n<p><strong>Frequency Response – </strong>Though humans have a hearing range of 20 Hz to 20kHz, premium headphones offer a frequency response from 5 Hz to 40 kHz. When one hears a lossless file, the waves corresponding to such frequencies are not truncated, and premium headphones do pick these waves up. This means that even if a bass frequency is more than 20 Hz, there might be a layered sound picked up from premium headphones. These are not necessarily audible, but subjectively it almost always makes a difference. Powerful headphones also pick up the faintest of sounds one might have never heard due to either a colored response, where the bass, mids, and trebles are off balance. A neutral headphone then would not sacrifice that background rhythm guitar or percussion for the vocals (usually mids or lower treble). Almost all audiophile headphones have a generated frequency response curve which can be googled and depending on one’s preferences and genres.</p>\\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous – </strong>One major aspect of audiophile headphones that cannot be overlooked are the impedance parameters of the headphones. Now impedance is simply the resistance of the coils to the electric current, and hence impedance is measured in <strong>Ohms</strong>. The lower the impedance, the easier it is to pass the current or to drive the headphones, which means it becomes easier to power them, by even a smartphone. However, many audiophile and monitoring headphones come in high impedance parameters since they are meant for use in studio mixing or equipment which have a built-in amplifier so that a lower impedance would result in the headphones being driven too easily. A kind of analogy might be driving a car on a lower gear to a higher gear. The low geared car if over accelerated will put stress on the engine and even total it. For optimum performance, the right shifting needs to be done. High impedance headphones usually above 100 ohms will be underpowered through a smartphone or a laptop, and produce poor quality low volume output. Such headphones require a dedicated headphone amplifier is used with a portable device, which will give justice to their price.</p>\\n<p>The second aspect is the soundstage. When we hear through normal headphones, it feels as if the sound is being played inside our head. But audiophile headphones, especially open backed ones have a soundstage so that when you hear through the headphones, it gives an illusion as if the sound is coming through actual speakers, with spatial effects for each instrument, and it feels that the sound is coming from around our head. This is much more fun, and also helps one to precisely pinpoint each instrument playing rather than a muddled mess, and hence suited for analytical or critical listening.</p>\\n<p><strong>MY VERDICT </strong><strong> </strong></p>\\n<p>I think most aspects at least for the beginner audiophile has been covered, and this section will fill out the practical gaps. The most important thing which is reiterated on all genuine audiophile forums is that you can be one at <strong>ANY BUDGET. </strong>So this will be a list of my recommendations at every budget point. The Audiophile hobby is a lifelong one, and though there are impulses to buy better amps or headphones, I would suggest the orthodox audiophile journey.</p>\\n<p><strong>You would need at least one pair of Earphones, and one set of open backed and one set of closed back headphones. At the beginner stage, you can start with earphones and one closed cans. Only buy Amps when you reach the second stage of beginner audiophiles, and perhaps DACs when you reach the mid-fi stage.</strong></p>\\n<h2><strong>Earphones/IEMs</strong></h2>\\n<p><strong>Starting Game</strong></p>\\n<p>This is the sub 1k genre, this is what the audio enthusiasts start with, and the good news is that even in this group, one can find earphones with noticeable quality improvements over stock buds. I think that it’s not worthwhile to get Sennheiser or Sony products at this range, and from the countless earphones I’ve tried, I’d recommend getting a Soundmagic e18, Creative ep 630 or JBLs.</p>\\n<p><strong>Mid Game</strong></p>\\n<p>This should be your default setting unless one is really into earphones. The RHA S500, Beyerdynamic Byron, Sennheiser CX series, Soundmagic e10, e50 or e80 are some of the best in this category. Try to look for an earphone with lots of ear tips, good warranty, sturdy build and tangle free cables.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_115\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-115\\\" style=\\\"width: 616px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-115\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/soundmagic-e10c-4-3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"soundmagic-e10c-4-3\\\" width=\\\"616\\\" height=\\\"347\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/soundmagic-e10c-4-3.jpg 616w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/soundmagic-e10c-4-3-300x169.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\\\" /><figcaption id=\\\"caption-attachment-115\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The Soundmagic E10C</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>End Game</strong></p>\\n<p>I am yet to reach this stage, but someday I’ll definitely think of getting some Shure’s IEMs which definitely would be my endgame. Please skip Bose products which are only good for sound cancellation. If you’re really into it, I would suggest having a look at Audeze’s IEMs</p>\\n<h2><strong>Closed Cans</strong><strong> </strong></h2>\\n<p><strong>Starting Game</strong></p>\\n<p>I highly recommend starting with Audio Technica’s M40xs, and rather than buying the more popular M50xs, you can use m40xs with some HM5 pads and have a better product. The m40x is much more neutral, and the pads very comfortable, unlike the fatiguing comfort and in your face bass and treble of the m50s.</p>\\n<div id='gallery-3' class='gallery galleryid-113 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-thumbnail'><figure class='gallery-item'>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href='http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/41gfqxe5obl-_sl500_ac_ss350_/'><img width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41gfqxe5obl-_sl500_ac_ss350_-150x150.jpg\\\" class=\\\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"gallery-3-116\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41gfqxe5obl-_sl500_ac_ss350_-150x150.jpg 150w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41gfqxe5obl-_sl500_ac_ss350_-300x300.jpg 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41gfqxe5obl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg 350w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\\\" /></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-3-116'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAudioTechnica M40X\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption></figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href='http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/samsung-csc/'><img width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/7404928-150x150.jpg\\\" class=\\\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"gallery-3-117\\\" /></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-3-117'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHM5 pads\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption></figure>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Mid Game</strong></p>\\n<p>If one has decided to keep two headphones, I highly recommend having a look at the Beyerdynamic dt770 pros, which come in three versions. Skip the 32 ohms one. These are a unique set of cans and offer excellent comfort, both in weight and the pads. One of the most comfortable headphones I’ve owned, and though these are studio monitor headphones, these have a V-shaped sound, but the Bass is amazingly awesome. I have not heard a better bass response on my electronic or Heavy Metal tracks and is very much controlled. The 80 ohms are the ones I recommend since they offer a better bass and slightly less treble. The 250 ohms’ version is the more standard one for recording, but it has, even more, treble in a phone already high in it, which can be piercing to some ears. The 600 ohms’ version would require HUGE amplification, and I won’t recommend that, though all three versions require a dedicated amp, the 80 ohms version can do with an entry level amp like the fiio e10k.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_118\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-118\\\" style=\\\"width: 1024px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"768\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958.jpg 1024w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958-300x225.jpg 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958-768x576.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /><figcaption id=\\\"caption-attachment-118\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Beyerdynamic DT770 Pros</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>End Game</strong></p>\\n<p>Again still I’m stuck in the mid-fi category, I’m more than happy with these closed cans, and would perhaps only upgrade my open set. The Beyerdynamic dt1770 has been released and has all the goods of the dt770s with so much more.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Open Cans</strong></h2>\\n<p><strong>Starting Game</strong></p>\\n<p>Now we come to the Sennheisers, who specialize in open cans. The Sennheiser HD series are some of the most neutral and amazing headphones you can buy. I highly recommend buying the HD598 Special edition series, or other variants in Sennheiser’s HD 5xx series if you can get them for cheap. The HD598 is THE MOST COMFORTABLE HEADPHONE I’VE EVER PUT ON. The sound is balanced, the bass isn’t too bad, the mids are exceptional, and the trebles are high but not as much as the Beyers. You can listen to them for hours without fatigue and can be driven without an amp, though a fiio can definitely help. Try to get a used one since these are the ones you’ll want to upgrade, I know I would, now I’ve tasted the truth of true audiophile sound.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_119\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-119\\\" style=\\\"width: 355px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"  wp-image-119 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_\\\" width=\\\"355\\\" height=\\\"463\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_.jpg 345w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_-230x300.jpg 230w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\\\" /><figcaption id=\\\"caption-attachment-119\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Sennheiser HD598 SR</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Mid Game</strong></p>\\n<p>The Philips Fidelio X2 series are some of the highest recommended phones. But my lifetime mid-fis would be again, the Sennheisers. Now the Sennheiser HD 600 and HD 650 are LEGENDARY headphones. Audio is something which suffers from diminishing returns, so when you buy a decent headphone from a cheap one, there is usually a world of difference, but the more money you keep on throwing, the difference would be marginal, and ultimately just a different type of sound, so it’s your decision on finding the optimal stopping point. But even if the HD600 and HD650s might offer a 15% improvement over the already stellar HD598s, then, why not? Given that they come at the same price as Bose’s QC35, which is at the same price, or even hi-fi systems, one can definitely get some exceptionally good headphones at the price. Maybe I’m biased. But these are notorious for their high (300 ohms) impedance and require some god research(not a typo) on the amps which will drive them, though you can’t go wrong with a Schiit stack(pronounced SHIT).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_121\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-121\\\" style=\\\"width: 750px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-121\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"1-1\\\" width=\\\"750\\\" height=\\\"425\\\" srcset=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.jpg 750w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1-300x170.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\" /><figcaption id=\\\"caption-attachment-121\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"></strong> <strong>Massdrop&#8217;s Sennheiser HD 6xx, a revamped version of the HD650s</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>End Game</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>LOL. </strong>I don’t know.

Whenever there is equipment dealing with high impedances, as in any high-quality system described above, the output current is low means the volume would not be sufficient to do the headphones justice. There are, of course, digital amplifier programs on your computer, but akin to a physical amplifier being like an optical zoom, the digital one is digital zoom, and we all know how digital zoom distorts the photograph. Same with sound. Dedicated Headphone amps would help get the proper juice (read power) to your headphones by amplifying the sound wave without distortion. Nothing much needs to be said for amps other than the usual rule of thumb so here it goes.</p>\\n<p><strong>MY VERDICT</strong></p>\\n<p>The Fiio e10k is an integrated DAC and amp which would suit the id fi game, until you deal with the Sennheiser 600 and above, after which you would require a much better amp. The only upgrade I can suggest which I think would not be wasteful is the popular Schiit Stack, that is the Schiit Modi amp and the Schiit Magni DAC. Tube amps are beyond my stage at present, but I shall keep updating.</p>\\n<div id='gallery-4' class='gallery galleryid-113 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><figure class='gallery-item'>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href='http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/dsc_0765/'><img width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/dsc_0765-150x150.jpg\\\" class=\\\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"gallery-4-124\\\" /></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-4-124'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFiio e10k USB DAC AMP\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption></figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href='http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/maxresdefault/'><img width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/maxresdefault-150x150.jpg\\\" class=\\\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"gallery-4-125\\\" /></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-4-125'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSCHIIT STACK.

Even among audiophiles, this judgment is present, and more strongly so, as the snobs will themselves consider many within the community to be audio-fools rather than audiophiles, regressing the irony further.</p>\n<p>So what is an audiophile? And what is my part in all of this? And why am I bothering the readers with an introduction to this niche community?</p>\n<p>An Audiophile, in the truest sense, is someone who enjoys or is obsessed with accurate sound reproduction, mostly applied to the music industry. The simple point is that in the process of production of music to consumption of it, we tend to miss out on details either from induced noise and distortion, poor equipment, compression, and so on. This post is an entry to this strange world so that anyone can benefit from the wisdom of the community with the least amount of foolery. I consider myself an audiophile simply because of my love of music, and I don’t mind spending at least some money more than average to enjoy one of the great joys of life. I have spent months going through various audiophile communities, and I can say enough to give my opinion which might help you understand the rationality and the irrationality of the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure: The world of Audiophiles is a slippery slope, and one can simply fall into the cycle of getting more equipment than needed, and this is not an exaggeration. So I suggest not going very deep into it, unless you are a music producer, or have lakhs of rupees to spend.</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s start with the basics, which starts with the physics of sound. The sound is generated by the rapid compression and decompression of air molecules, which have a frequency. This vibration takes the form of a wave. Our voice to the drums to strings of a guitar and all instruments work on this principle. The sound wave reaches our ear-drums or a microphone, which vibrates accordingly to the compressions of air, producing electric signals, leading to our perception of the sound. The average human ear can hear frequencies from 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz.</p>\n<h1><strong>The Source</strong></h1>\n<p>In the studio, the music produced is picked up by high-quality microphones, and electrically stored as .wav files, and recorded into various storage devices such as the vinyl or cassette in analog form. These .wav files are raw files and usually are suited for studio mixing and remastering since each wave file can be massive, and unpractical for portable use.</p>\n<p>The analog wave is then converted into a digital format and compressed using various technologies. The most popular one is, of course, the mp3 file, which is an example of lossy compression. The basic point is that the algorithm for an mp3 file simply cuts out all frequencies below and beyond the human range, and masks out other, usually inaudible or barely audible sounds to present a file of magnitudes of smaller size. The mp3 files also differ in the amount of information cut from the original file, and while the ubiquitous 128 kbps is fine for streaming services, the 320 kbps is larger and more applicable for critical listening.</p>\n<p>Audiophiles usually prefer the analog reproduction though if possible, that is the vinyl, or the DVD of an album, for digital music, they prefer lossless conversion formats such as .flac files, which are much larger than an mp3 file but retains all of the subsonic and supersonic frequencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict #1 – I suggest that if one doesn’t have high fidelity audio equipment, and just wants to do some casual listening then low bit rate mp3s are fine. But I highly suggest that for critical listening and using good audio equipment, 320 kbps mp3 files and FLAC files are a must, at least for the albums you really love, and the classics such as Kind of Blue by Miles Davis or The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. I would expand a bit more on this when I come to equipment.</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<h1><strong>The Reproduction</strong><strong> </strong></h1>\n<p>The next part is the reverse. Now we need to convert the digital files stored on your smartphone or laptop to your equipment. I will focus on headphones for this post since they offer the highest fidelity in the least amount of money and convenience. The vinyl or the DVDs usually have to be used with a hi-fi stereo system, which I might do in another post. There are three parts to reproduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital to Analog conversion – </strong>Speakers are reverse microphones. They receive electric signals and a diaphragm vibrates, compressing the air and producing sound. It’s obvious that your speakers don’t read 0s and 1s as what your computer stores the files as. All smartphones and laptops have a built-in DAC, called a Digital to Analog converter. In India, we simply call them sound cards. Now though your onboard DAC is usually good enough for casual listening, when listening to high-quality files with high-quality equipment, we can run into some trouble.</p>\n<p>A really good headphone can pick up frequency ranges a lot larger than our hearing capability. Coupled with a good quality source file, a lesser quality DAC will reproduce signals which would have induced noise and distortion, which would be easily picked up by your headphones, hampering your experience. The point is that in the analog to digital conversion by studios, it is obvious they use the highest quality equipment to prevent noise and distortion, but the reproduction of the reverse is our responsibility to bear. However, this is contentious because the modern day onboard DACs are improving in quality so that external DAC which are cheaper might go redundant. So unless you have really good headphones, the DAC can be thought about over time, depending on your satisfaction with the music.</p>\n<h1><strong>Headphones </strong></h1>\n<p>Coming to the most important part of the audiophile discussion. Let’s start with the basics of types of Headphones. I’m going to assume that the fit is of the over the ears variety which offers the best in terms of comfort and quality, with portability being the trade-off. But before that, we need to go through some basic terminologies used in the world of head-fi.</p>\n<p><strong>Open vs Closed –</strong> Open back headphones have ear cups which are covered by grills on the outer side, which effectively means that your headphones are no longer isolated from the outside world. This means that not only will the sound of your headphones leak outside, but you won’t be insulated from the outside environment at all. Closed back headphones are fully covered on the outside, providing the necessary isolation.</p>\n<p>So why would anyone buy open backed headphones? Well, they are open for a reason. The openness of the cans gives you an airy and a more natural feel towards the music. It provides scope for a much larger soundstage as if one is hearing to the music live. The closed back as is obvious, provides isolation, doesn’t disturb others, and is usually stated to have scope for a larger bass response than the open cans.</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Signature – </strong>Every headphone sounds different, but for an audiophile, it is imperative to know what the difference is, and what the music should really sound like. Now it is known that most cheap earphones and some branded <strong>cough</strong> Beats <strong>cough</strong> headphones are geared towards bass. Audiophiles have two issues regarding this. It is not that Audiophiles don’t love their bass, but the bass from cheap quality sets is what is called a muddy bass, or uncontrolled bass. Audiophiles love the tightness in their music, and a controlled bass even though less in magnitude, is high in quality. The second is that Audiophiles by definition, want a neutral sound signature. The easiest way to visualize this is that each headphone has its own adjusted Equalizer settings, which one can’t change. This invisible equalizer is the sound signature. When the equalizer is flat or off, we deem it as neutral, which many of us might know can seem boring to the untrained, but over time, one extracts a purer sound, just as the artists wanted us to hear it. Audiophiles though are not always interested in listening to music critically or analytically, pointing out each individual notes, and hence there are also V-shaped signature phones, which means an elevated bass and treble response, which is more fatiguing to the ear but much more fun.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Driver Technology – </strong>There are three technologies through which sound is reproduced. The most popular ones mostly in all headphones below Rs. 30,000 are dynamic drivers. There is also a planar magnetic technology, which is heavy and offers much warmer and powerful bass response, and at the highest levels are electrostatic headphones, which use capacitive technology and need extremely high voltages to drive them.</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency Response – </strong>Though humans have a hearing range of 20 Hz to 20kHz, premium headphones offer a frequency response from 5 Hz to 40 kHz. When one hears a lossless file, the waves corresponding to such frequencies are not truncated, and premium headphones do pick these waves up. This means that even if a bass frequency is more than 20 Hz, there might be a layered sound picked up from premium headphones. These are not necessarily audible, but subjectively it almost always makes a difference. Powerful headphones also pick up the faintest of sounds one might have never heard due to either a colored response, where the bass, mids, and trebles are off balance. A neutral headphone then would not sacrifice that background rhythm guitar or percussion for the vocals (usually mids or lower treble). Almost all audiophile headphones have a generated frequency response curve which can be googled and depending on one’s preferences and genres.</p>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous – </strong>One major aspect of audiophile headphones that cannot be overlooked are the impedance parameters of the headphones. Now impedance is simply the resistance of the coils to the electric current, and hence impedance is measured in <strong>Ohms</strong>. The lower the impedance, the easier it is to pass the current or to drive the headphones, which means it becomes easier to power them, by even a smartphone. However, many audiophile and monitoring headphones come in high impedance parameters since they are meant for use in studio mixing or equipment which have a built-in amplifier so that a lower impedance would result in the headphones being driven too easily. A kind of analogy might be driving a car on a lower gear to a higher gear. The low geared car if over accelerated will put stress on the engine and even total it. For optimum performance, the right shifting needs to be done. High impedance headphones usually above 100 ohms will be underpowered through a smartphone or a laptop, and produce poor quality low volume output. Such headphones require a dedicated headphone amplifier is used with a portable device, which will give justice to their price.</p>\n<p>The second aspect is the soundstage. When we hear through normal headphones, it feels as if the sound is being played inside our head. But audiophile headphones, especially open backed ones have a soundstage so that when you hear through the headphones, it gives an illusion as if the sound is coming through actual speakers, with spatial effects for each instrument, and it feels that the sound is coming from around our head. This is much more fun, and also helps one to precisely pinpoint each instrument playing rather than a muddled mess, and hence suited for analytical or critical listening.</p>\n<p><strong>MY VERDICT </strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>I think most aspects at least for the beginner audiophile has been covered, and this section will fill out the practical gaps. The most important thing which is reiterated on all genuine audiophile forums is that you can be one at <strong>ANY BUDGET. </strong>So this will be a list of my recommendations at every budget point. The Audiophile hobby is a lifelong one, and though there are impulses to buy better amps or headphones, I would suggest the orthodox audiophile journey.</p>\n<p><strong>You would need at least one pair of Earphones, and one set of open backed and one set of closed back headphones. At the beginner stage, you can start with earphones and one closed cans. Only buy Amps when you reach the second stage of beginner audiophiles, and perhaps DACs when you reach the mid-fi stage.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Earphones/IEMs</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Starting Game</strong></p>\n<p>This is the sub 1k genre, this is what the audio enthusiasts start with, and the good news is that even in this group, one can find earphones with noticeable quality improvements over stock buds. I think that it’s not worthwhile to get Sennheiser or Sony products at this range, and from the countless earphones I’ve tried, I’d recommend getting a Soundmagic e18, Creative ep 630 or JBLs.</p>\n<p><strong>Mid Game</strong></p>\n<p>This should be your default setting unless one is really into earphones. The RHA S500, Beyerdynamic Byron, Sennheiser CX series, Soundmagic e10, e50 or e80 are some of the best in this category. Try to look for an earphone with lots of ear tips, good warranty, sturdy build and tangle free cables.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_115\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-115\" style=\"width: 616px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-115\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/soundmagic-e10c-4-3.jpg\" alt=\"soundmagic-e10c-4-3\" width=\"616\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/soundmagic-e10c-4-3.jpg 616w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/soundmagic-e10c-4-3-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-115\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Soundmagic E10C</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>End Game</strong></p>\n<p>I am yet to reach this stage, but someday I’ll definitely think of getting some Shure’s IEMs which definitely would be my endgame.

Skip the 32 ohms one. These are a unique set of cans and offer excellent comfort, both in weight and the pads. One of the most comfortable headphones I’ve owned, and though these are studio monitor headphones, these have a V-shaped sound, but the Bass is amazingly awesome. I have not heard a better bass response on my electronic or Heavy Metal tracks and is very much controlled. The 80 ohms are the ones I recommend since they offer a better bass and slightly less treble. The 250 ohms’ version is the more standard one for recording, but it has, even more, treble in a phone already high in it, which can be piercing to some ears. The 600 ohms’ version would require HUGE amplification, and I won’t recommend that, though all three versions require a dedicated amp, the 80 ohms version can do with an entry level amp like the fiio e10k.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_118\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-118\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958.jpg\" alt=\"beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958.jpg 1024w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958-300x225.jpg 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-32-ohms-459958-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-118\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Beyerdynamic DT770 Pros</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>End Game</strong></p>\n<p>Again still I’m stuck in the mid-fi category, I’m more than happy with these closed cans, and would perhaps only upgrade my open set. The Beyerdynamic dt1770 has been released and has all the goods of the dt770s with so much more.</p>\n<h2><strong>Open Cans</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Starting Game</strong></p>\n<p>Now we come to the Sennheisers, who specialize in open cans. The Sennheiser HD series are some of the most neutral and amazing headphones you can buy. I highly recommend buying the HD598 Special edition series, or other variants in Sennheiser’s HD 5xx series if you can get them for cheap. The HD598 is THE MOST COMFORTABLE HEADPHONE I’VE EVER PUT ON. The sound is balanced, the bass isn’t too bad, the mids are exceptional, and the trebles are high but not as much as the Beyers. You can listen to them for hours without fatigue and can be driven without an amp, though a fiio can definitely help. Try to get a used one since these are the ones you’ll want to upgrade, I know I would, now I’ve tasted the truth of true audiophile sound.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_119\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-119\" style=\"width: 355px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"  wp-image-119 aligncenter\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_.jpg\" alt=\"41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_\" width=\"355\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_.jpg 345w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/41x8zpjlkjl-_sy450_-230x300.jpg 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-119\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sennheiser HD598 SR</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mid Game</strong></p>\n<p>The Philips Fidelio X2 series are some of the highest recommended phones. But my lifetime mid-fis would be again, the Sennheisers. Now the Sennheiser HD 600 and HD 650 are LEGENDARY headphones. Audio is something which suffers from diminishing returns, so when you buy a decent headphone from a cheap one, there is usually a world of difference, but the more money you keep on throwing, the difference would be marginal, and ultimately just a different type of sound, so it’s your decision on finding the optimal stopping point. But even if the HD600 and HD650s might offer a 15% improvement over the already stellar HD598s, then, why not? Given that they come at the same price as Bose’s QC35, which is at the same price, or even hi-fi systems, one can definitely get some exceptionally good headphones at the price. Maybe I’m biased. But these are notorious for their high (300 ohms) impedance and require some god research(not a typo) on the amps which will drive them, though you can’t go wrong with a Schiit stack(pronounced SHIT).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-121\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"1-1\" width=\"750\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1.jpg 750w, /content/images/wordpress/2017/11/1-1-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"></strong> <strong>Massdrop&#8217;s Sennheiser HD 6xx, a revamped version of the HD650s</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>End Game</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LOL. </strong>I don’t know.

Whenever there is equipment dealing with high impedances, as in any high-quality system described above, the output current is low means the volume would not be sufficient to do the headphones justice. There are, of course, digital amplifier programs on your computer, but akin to a physical amplifier being like an optical zoom, the digital one is digital zoom, and we all know how digital zoom distorts the photograph. Same with sound. Dedicated Headphone amps would help get the proper juice (read power) to your headphones by amplifying the sound wave without distortion. Nothing much needs to be said for amps other than the usual rule of thumb so here it goes.</p>\n<p><strong>MY VERDICT</strong></p>\n<p>The Fiio e10k is an integrated DAC and amp which would suit the id fi game, until you deal with the Sennheiser 600 and above, after which you would require a much better amp. The only upgrade I can suggest which I think would not be wasteful is the popular Schiit Stack, that is the Schiit Modi amp and the Schiit Magni DAC. Tube amps are beyond my stage at present, but I shall keep updating.</p>\n<div id='gallery-4' class='gallery galleryid-113 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/dsc_0765/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/dsc_0765-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-4-124\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-4-124'>\n\t\t\t\tFiio e10k USB DAC AMP\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption></figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/maxresdefault/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"/content/images/wordpress/2017/11/maxresdefault-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-4-125\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-4-125'>\n\t\t\t\tSCHIIT STACK.

Even among audiophiles, this judgment\nis present, and more strongly so, as the snobs will themselves consider many\nwithin the community to be audio-fools rather than audiophiles, regressing the\nirony further.\n\nSo what is an audiophile? And what is my part in all of this? And why am I\nbothering the readers with an introduction to this niche community?\n\nAn Audiophile, in the truest sense, is someone who enjoys or is obsessed with\naccurate sound reproduction, mostly applied to the music industry. The simple\npoint is that in the process of production of music to consumption of it, we\ntend to miss out on details either from induced noise and distortion, poor\nequipment, compression, and so on. This post is an entry to this strange world\nso that anyone can benefit from the wisdom of the community with the least\namount of foolery. I consider myself an audiophile simply because of my love of\nmusic, and I don’t mind spending at least some money more than average to enjoy\none of the great joys of life. I have spent months going through various\naudiophile communities, and I can say enough to give my opinion which might help\nyou understand the rationality and the irrationality of the community.\n\nDisclosure: The world of Audiophiles is a slippery slope, and one can simply\nfall into the cycle of getting more equipment than needed, and this is not an\nexaggeration. So I suggest not going very deep into it, unless you are a music\nproducer, or have lakhs of rupees to spend.\n\nSo let’s start with the basics, which starts with the physics of sound. The\nsound is generated by the rapid compression and decompression of air molecules,\nwhich have a frequency. This vibration takes the form of a wave. Our voice to\nthe drums to strings of a guitar and all instruments work on this principle. The\nsound wave reaches our ear-drums or a microphone, which vibrates accordingly to\nthe compressions of air, producing electric signals, leading to our perception\nof the sound. The average human ear can hear frequencies from 20 Hertz to 20,000\nHertz.\n\nThe Source\nIn the studio, the music produced is picked up by high-quality microphones, and\nelectrically stored as .wav files, and recorded into various storage devices\nsuch as the vinyl or cassette in analog form. These .wav files are raw files and\nusually are suited for studio mixing and remastering since each wave file can be\nmassive, and unpractical for portable use.\n\nThe analog wave is then converted into a digital format and compressed using\nvarious technologies. The most popular one is, of course, the mp3 file, which is\nan example of lossy compression. The basic point is that the algorithm for an\nmp3 file simply cuts out all frequencies below and beyond the human range, and\nmasks out other, usually inaudible or barely audible sounds to present a file of\nmagnitudes of smaller size. The mp3 files also differ in the amount of\ninformation cut from the original file, and while the ubiquitous 128 kbps is\nfine for streaming services, the 320 kbps is larger and more applicable for\ncritical listening.\n\nAudiophiles usually prefer the analog reproduction though if possible, that is\nthe vinyl, or the DVD of an album, for digital music, they prefer lossless\nconversion formats such as .flac files, which are much larger than an mp3 file\nbut retains all of the subsonic and supersonic frequencies.\n\nVerdict #1 – I suggest that if one doesn’t have high fidelity audio equipment,\nand just wants to do some casual listening then low bit rate mp3s are fine. But\nI highly suggest that for critical listening and using good audio equipment, 320\nkbps mp3 files and FLAC files are a must, at least for the albums you really\nlove, and the classics such as Kind of Blue by Miles Davis or The Dark Side of\nthe Moon by Pink Floyd. I would expand a bit more on this when I come to\nequipment.\n\nThe Reproduction\nThe next part is the reverse. Now we need to convert the digital files stored on\nyour smartphone or laptop to your equipment. I will focus on headphones for this\npost since they offer the highest fidelity in the least amount of money and\nconvenience. The vinyl or the DVDs usually have to be used with a hi-fi stereo\nsystem, which I might do in another post. There are three parts to reproduction.\n\nDigital to Analog conversion – Speakers are reverse microphones. They receive\nelectric signals and a diaphragm vibrates, compressing the air and producing\nsound. It’s obvious that your speakers don’t read 0s and 1s as what your\ncomputer stores the files as. All smartphones and laptops have a built-in DAC,\ncalled a Digital to Analog converter. In India, we simply call them sound cards.\nNow though your onboard DAC is usually good enough for casual listening, when\nlistening to high-quality files with high-quality equipment, we can run into\nsome trouble.\n\nA really good headphone can pick up frequency ranges a lot larger than our\nhearing capability. Coupled with a good quality source file, a lesser quality\nDAC will reproduce signals which would have induced noise and distortion, which\nwould be easily picked up by your headphones, hampering your experience. The\npoint is that in the analog to digital conversion by studios, it is obvious they\nuse the highest quality equipment to prevent noise and distortion, but the\nreproduction of the reverse is our responsibility to bear. However, this is\ncontentious because the modern day onboard DACs are improving in quality so that\nexternal DAC which are cheaper might go redundant. So unless you have really\ngood headphones, the DAC can be thought about over time, depending on your\nsatisfaction with the music.\n\nHeadphones \nComing to the most important part of the audiophile discussion. Let’s start with\nthe basics of types of Headphones. I’m going to assume that the fit is of the\nover the ears variety which offers the best in terms of comfort and quality,\nwith portability being the trade-off. But before that, we need to go through\nsome basic terminologies used in the world of head-fi.\n\nOpen vs Closed – Open back headphones have ear cups which are covered by grills\non the outer side, which effectively means that your headphones are no longer\nisolated from the outside world. This means that not only will the sound of your\nheadphones leak outside, but you won’t be insulated from the outside environment\nat all. Closed back headphones are fully covered on the outside, providing the\nnecessary isolation.\n\nSo why would anyone buy open backed headphones? Well, they are open for a\nreason. The openness of the cans gives you an airy and a more natural feel\ntowards the music. It provides scope for a much larger soundstage as if one is\nhearing to the music live. The closed back as is obvious, provides isolation,\ndoesn’t disturb others, and is usually stated to have scope for a larger bass\nresponse than the open cans.\n\nSound Signature – Every headphone sounds different, but for an audiophile, it is\nimperative to know what the difference is, and what the music should really\nsound like. Now it is known that most cheap earphones and some branded cough \nBeats cough headphones are geared towards bass. Audiophiles have two issues\nregarding this. It is not that Audiophiles don’t love their bass, but the bass\nfrom cheap quality sets is what is called a muddy bass, or uncontrolled bass.\nAudiophiles love the tightness in their music, and a controlled bass even though\nless in magnitude, is high in quality. The second is that Audiophiles by\ndefinition, want a neutral sound signature. The easiest way to visualize this is\nthat each headphone has its own adjusted Equalizer settings, which one can’t\nchange. This invisible equalizer is the sound signature. When the equalizer is\nflat or off, we deem it as neutral, which many of us might know can seem boring\nto the untrained, but over time, one extracts a purer sound, just as the artists\nwanted us to hear it. Audiophiles though are not always interested in listening\nto music critically or analytically, pointing out each individual notes, and\nhence there are also V-shaped signature phones, which means an elevated bass and\ntreble response, which is more fatiguing to the ear but much more fun.\n\nDriver Technology – There are three technologies through which sound is\nreproduced. The most popular ones mostly in all headphones below Rs. 30,000 are\ndynamic drivers. There is also a planar magnetic technology, which is heavy and\noffers much warmer and powerful bass response, and at the highest levels are\nelectrostatic headphones, which use capacitive technology and need extremely\nhigh voltages to drive them.\n\nFrequency Response – Though humans have a hearing range of 20 Hz to 20kHz,\npremium headphones offer a frequency response from 5 Hz to 40 kHz. When one\nhears a lossless file, the waves corresponding to such frequencies are not\ntruncated, and premium headphones do pick these waves up. This means that even\nif a bass frequency is more than 20 Hz, there might be a layered sound picked up\nfrom premium headphones. These are not necessarily audible, but subjectively it\nalmost always makes a difference. Powerful headphones also pick up the faintest\nof sounds one might have never heard due to either a colored response, where the\nbass, mids, and trebles are off balance. A neutral headphone then would not\nsacrifice that background rhythm guitar or percussion for the vocals (usually\nmids or lower treble). Almost all audiophile headphones have a generated\nfrequency response curve which can be googled and depending on one’s preferences\nand genres.\n\nMiscellaneous – One major aspect of audiophile headphones that cannot be\noverlooked are the impedance parameters of the headphones. Now impedance is\nsimply the resistance of the coils to the electric current, and hence impedance\nis measured in Ohms. The lower the impedance, the easier it is to pass the\ncurrent or to drive the headphones, which means it becomes easier to power them,\nby even a smartphone. However, many audiophile and monitoring headphones come in\nhigh impedance parameters since they are meant for use in studio mixing or\nequipment which have a built-in amplifier so that a lower impedance would result\nin the headphones being driven too easily. A kind of analogy might be driving a\ncar on a lower gear to a higher gear. The low geared car if over accelerated\nwill put stress on the engine and even total it. For optimum performance, the\nright shifting needs to be done. High impedance headphones usually above 100\nohms will be underpowered through a smartphone or a laptop, and produce poor\nquality low volume output. Such headphones require a dedicated headphone\namplifier is used with a portable device, which will give justice to their\nprice.\n\nThe second aspect is the soundstage. When we hear through normal headphones, it\nfeels as if the sound is being played inside our head. But audiophile\nheadphones, especially open backed ones have a soundstage so that when you hear\nthrough the headphones, it gives an illusion as if the sound is coming through\nactual speakers, with spatial effects for each instrument, and it feels that the\nsound is coming from around our head. This is much more fun, and also helps one\nto precisely pinpoint each instrument playing rather than a muddled mess, and\nhence suited for analytical or critical listening.\n\nMY VERDICT \n\nI think most aspects at least for the beginner audiophile has been covered, and\nthis section will fill out the practical gaps. The most important thing which is\nreiterated on all genuine audiophile forums is that you can be one at ANY\nBUDGET. So this will be a list of my recommendations at every budget point. The\nAudiophile hobby is a lifelong one, and though there are impulses to buy better\namps or headphones, I would suggest the orthodox audiophile journey.\n\nYou would need at least one pair of Earphones, and one set of open backed and\none set of closed back headphones. At the beginner stage, you can start with\nearphones and one closed cans. Only buy Amps when you reach the second stage of\nbeginner audiophiles, and perhaps DACs when you reach the mid-fi stage.\n\nEarphones/IEMs\nStarting Game\n\nThis is the sub 1k genre, this is what the audio enthusiasts start with, and the\ngood news is that even in this group, one can find earphones with noticeable\nquality improvements over stock buds. I think that it’s not worthwhile to get\nSennheiser or Sony products at this range, and from the countless earphones I’ve\ntried, I’d recommend getting a Soundmagic e18, Creative ep 630 or JBLs.\n\nMid Game\n\nThis should be your default setting unless one is really into earphones. The RHA\nS500, Beyerdynamic Byron, Sennheiser CX series, Soundmagic e10, e50 or e80 are\nsome of the best in this category. Try to look for an earphone with lots of ear\ntips, good warranty, sturdy build and tangle free cables.\n\n\n\nThe Soundmagic E10C\n\nEnd Game\n\nI am yet to reach this stage, but someday I’ll definitely think of getting some\nShure’s IEMs which definitely would be my endgame. Please skip Bose products\nwhich are only good for sound cancellation. If you’re really into it, I would\nsuggest having a look at Audeze’s IEMs\n\nClosed Cans\nStarting Game\n\nI highly recommend starting with Audio Technica’s M40xs, and rather than buying\nthe more popular M50xs, you can use m40xs with some HM5 pads and have a better\nproduct. The m40x is much more neutral, and the pads very comfortable, unlike\nthe fatiguing comfort and in your face bass and treble of the m50s.\n\n[http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/41gfqxe5obl-_sl500_ac_ss350_/]\nAudioTechnica M40X \n[http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/samsung-csc/]HM5\npads\n\nMid Game\n\nIf one has decided to keep two headphones, I highly recommend having a look at\nthe Beyerdynamic dt770 pros, which come in three versions. Skip the 32 ohms one.\nThese are a unique set of cans and offer excellent comfort, both in weight and\nthe pads. One of the most comfortable headphones I’ve owned, and though these\nare studio monitor headphones, these have a V-shaped sound, but the Bass is\namazingly awesome. I have not heard a better bass response on my electronic or\nHeavy Metal tracks and is very much controlled. The 80 ohms are the ones I\nrecommend since they offer a better bass and slightly less treble. The 250 ohms’\nversion is the more standard one for recording, but it has, even more, treble in\na phone already high in it, which can be piercing to some ears. The 600 ohms’\nversion would require HUGE amplification, and I won’t recommend that, though all\nthree versions require a dedicated amp, the 80 ohms version can do with an entry\nlevel amp like the fiio e10k.\n\n\n\nBeyerdynamic DT770 Pros\n\n\n\nEnd Game\n\nAgain still I’m stuck in the mid-fi category, I’m more than happy with these\nclosed cans, and would perhaps only upgrade my open set. The Beyerdynamic dt1770\nhas been released and has all the goods of the dt770s with so much more.\n\nOpen Cans\nStarting Game\n\nNow we come to the Sennheisers, who specialize in open cans. The Sennheiser HD\nseries are some of the most neutral and amazing headphones you can buy. I highly\nrecommend buying the HD598 Special edition series, or other variants in\nSennheiser’s HD 5xx series if you can get them for cheap. The HD598 is THE MOST\nCOMFORTABLE HEADPHONE I’VE EVER PUT ON. The sound is balanced, the bass isn’t\ntoo bad, the mids are exceptional, and the trebles are high but not as much as\nthe Beyers. You can listen to them for hours without fatigue and can be driven\nwithout an amp, though a fiio can definitely help. Try to get a used one since\nthese are the ones you’ll want to upgrade, I know I would, now I’ve tasted the\ntruth of true audiophile sound.\n\n\n\nSennheiser HD598 SR\n\nMid Game\n\nThe Philips Fidelio X2 series are some of the highest recommended phones. But my\nlifetime mid-fis would be again, the Sennheisers. Now the Sennheiser HD 600 and\nHD 650 are LEGENDARY headphones. Audio is something which suffers from\ndiminishing returns, so when you buy a decent headphone from a cheap one, there\nis usually a world of difference, but the more money you keep on throwing, the\ndifference would be marginal, and ultimately just a different type of sound, so\nit’s your decision on finding the optimal stopping point. But even if the HD600\nand HD650s might offer a 15% improvement over the already stellar HD598s, then,\nwhy not? Given that they come at the same price as Bose’s QC35, which is at the\nsame price, or even hi-fi systems, one can definitely get some exceptionally\ngood headphones at the price. Maybe I’m biased. But these are notorious for\ntheir high (300 ohms) impedance and require some god research(not a typo) on the\namps which will drive them, though you can’t go wrong with a Schiit\nstack(pronounced SHIT).\n\n\n\nMassdrop’s Sennheiser HD 6xx, a revamped version of the HD650s\n\nEnd Game\n\nLOL. I don’t know. I’ve reserved my endgame to a distant point in life as of\nnow. But if I were given a gift to choose, Beyerdynamic T1, Sennheiser HD800 S,\nHifiman 1000, Audeze LCD 3s, Stax, etc. If you’re willing to spend in this\nrange( a lakh or more I’ll assume you already know much more than me), so enjoy,\nand yes, I understand you, unless you’re spending your dad’s money on them, then\ntch tch. Buy your beats.\n\n\n\nAudeze’s LCD 3, retailing at above Rs 1 lakh are Planar magnetic headphones\n\nOnline communities such as Reddit’s Headphone community, Head-fi, ZeosPantera\nreviews have a lot of details if you’re interested in further research.\n\n\n\nSTAX Lambda series Electrostatic headphones. These are definitely endgame.\n\nAmplifier\nAmplifiers are present in all stereo sound systems. Whenever there is equipment\ndealing with high impedances, as in any high-quality system described above, the\noutput current is low means the volume would not be sufficient to do the\nheadphones justice. There are, of course, digital amplifier programs on your\ncomputer, but akin to a physical amplifier being like an optical zoom, the\ndigital one is digital zoom, and we all know how digital zoom distorts the\nphotograph. Same with sound. Dedicated Headphone amps would help get the proper\njuice (read power) to your headphones by amplifying the sound wave without\ndistortion. Nothing much needs to be said for amps other than the usual rule of\nthumb so here it goes.\n\nMY VERDICT\n\nThe Fiio e10k is an integrated DAC and amp which would suit the id fi game,\nuntil you deal with the Sennheiser 600 and above, after which you would require\na much better amp. The only upgrade I can suggest which I think would not be\nwasteful is the popular Schiit Stack, that is the Schiit Modi amp and the Schiit\nMagni DAC. Tube amps are beyond my stage at present, but I shall keep updating.\n\n[http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/dsc_0765/]Fiio e10k\nUSB DAC AMP \n[http://192.168.64.2/2017/11/20/confessions-of-an-audiophile/maxresdefault/]\nSCHIIT STACK. MAGNI and MODIConclusion\nEven at such a length, I’ve barely scratched the surface of Audiophilia, but at\nleast now you can jump on the boat.

The latter means it is flexible enough to absorb elements from other sciences and social sciences, which has already become apparent in the fields of Evolutionary Biology, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and the focus of the dissertation, Information Theory and Linguistics (including Philosophy of Language). This intermingling of disciplines makes both fields better off, where linguists can take advantage of strategic interaction, optimality, and efficiency results while we can incorporate theories of communication and language from them. It is my personal opinion that the world is offered to us as it is, the fields are artificially constructed and in their rigidity, we miss out on some potentially important discoveries. It is with an optimistic observation of seeing the walls among disciplines break, that has inspired me to work on a dissertation across disciplines.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 1\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>Language is the mechanism through which humans communicate. Without some form of Language, no interaction at the present scale of economic affairs would have been conceivable. Not only do we communicate in language, but we also think and learn in terms of language (Whorf – 1956; Wittgenstein – 1921). Economics despite its affirmation as the ‘Queen of Social Sciences’ has neglected to delve into linguistic effects on economic behavior. The Present treatment of communication has also been fairly recent, with Spence’s theory of costly signaling, and game theoretic models of costless signaling, after the seminal work of Crawford and Sobel (1982) and follow up literature dubbed as Cheap Talk games. The framework of these games have their roots in Lewis’ Sender-Receiver games (1969) where the sender observes a state, sends a message, the receiver takes the action conditional on the message which affects both their payoffs. Many leading economists as well as from the outside have voiced concerns of treating communication among humans in a model of ‘Animal Communication’ (Lipman – 2009; Rubinstein – 2000) the primary argument of which is that such games are mostly concerned with the strategies associated with a message rather than the content of the message which under a linguistic signal can have varying effects apart from what the papers suggest.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 1\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>With the aforementioned motivations in mind, my dissertation would be a compilation of essays on classic problems of Microeconomic theory with language as the mode of analysis. Since Language and Linguistics are as broad a field as Economics and deals with subject matters relating to Speech Patterns, Etymology, Sociolinguistics, it is to be made clear at the outset that before such an analysis, a theory needs to be established to make concepts from such theories amenable to economic analysis. This means two things: &#8211;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 1\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>1. Language, as studied in ‘Language and Economics’ domain under cultural and social economics, a survey for which is given by Grin (2009), deals with sociolinguistic aspects of language in economic life, for example, differential wages of Francophones and Anglophones. However, the treatment of language in my dissertation would be a complete abstraction of language, drawn from linguistic philosophy to conceive of a language which can refer to a natural language, an artificial language, or even a nonexistent language abstraction, as the analysis deems fit.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>2. Though my proposed dissertation is closer in spirit to Marshack (1965) and Rubinstein (2000), who have tried to analyze aspects of Language efficiency and analysis through economic methods, it is not what my dissertation proposes to study. The work which is closest to my objectives is “Is Language vague” (Lipman, 2009), but as discussed above, it provides a framework developed in the style of Cheap Talk literature, and itself concludes that the quirks of linguistic effects on information transmission can at best be studied within a boundedly rational model.</p>\\n<p><strong>DISSERTATION OUTLINE</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>The first section of the dissertation would outline aspects from linguistic theory to define an abstract conception of language, and how it relates to notions of data, information, knowledge, technical proficiency, wisdom and practical usage. It will elucidate how language can treat these processes relatively to signaling theory. For a formalization of language, it is imperative to be aware that this is not an end but a means to study market outcomes and behavior, and hence only aspects of linguistics which are general and applicable would be used for analysis. Philosophy of language is useful in this aspect, particularly those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, notwithstanding some of the most insightful views of language but also because his work transitioned from a purely logical conception of language in his early work (Wittgenstein &#8211; 1922 ), to the strict rejection and more naturalistic view of it in his later work (Wittgenstein &#8211; 1953). The formalization of the two models would provide us with the option of comparing statics to providing a dynamic model of language evolution1 from the former to the latter, and its welfare effects on the market participants. Other aspects of Language philosophy and Linguistics would be borrowed from the works of Pierce, de Saussure, Chomsky, Frege, Russell, and others to create a simple but hybrid conception of language which embodies information and knowledge within its structure.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>After the conception of a linguistic model for economic agents, the dissertation will apply it to three classic problems in Information Economics literature (though other fields are not yet excluded). The following sections will cover each of these.</p>\\n<p><strong>THE MARKET FOR EXPERT SERVICES</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>Certain markets for expert services such as for medical treatment, legal consultation, car repair, financial services etc. pose problems on account of the large information asymmetries between the sellers(experts) and the consumers. Darby and Karni(1973) labeled them as Credence Good markets, where unlike experience goods, the quality and quantity of treatment cannot be verified even post-transaction. Dulleck and Kerschbamer(2006) in their analysis and survey of articles pertaining to such literature point out that price signals fail to transmit information about the parameters and tend to be flat among poor and good experts alike. The Experts can take advantage of the information gap and hence are incentivized to deceive particularly the less sophisticated or naïve buyers.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>While Dulleck and Kerschbamer(2006) do suggest that to minimize the probability of being deceived, one has to end up choosing the busiest or an expert who charges a premium, they do not account for that when experts do have a capacity constraint, their incentive for putting less effort per consumer increases. In fact, as has been empirically shown in health markets of developing countries where public hospitals can at most give 3.2 minutes on average per patient (Das et al, 2008).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>FOOTNOTE &#8211; </strong>Language here would be defined as a ‘market language’ – An abstraction which assumes that if the analysis is of a market, then the world is divided into two ontologies, where each ontology would be described by a language. So for the real world which encompasses the Economic world a natural language – English, and for the participants of the market, a language which describes their ontology better than the vague natural language. We will call this language “Oikos”. It is important to note here that “</em>oikos<em>” is a specialized language projected in the natural language. For e.g. The word Equilibrium exists both in real ontology and Economic ontology – but might mean completely different things in each specification.</em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 3\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>The first essay proposes to analyze such markets where I assume that all market participants (buyers, sellers, intermediaries) are distributed spatially according to their proficiency in that market’s language. So if L is the market language, the market participants are identified on the basis of their endowment of L in the static game. The experts are assumed to be ‘trained with certification’ and the only way agents can learn the language is by experience. The spatial distribution makes this model one with vertical differentiation, but since the consumers cannot distinguish the seller’s type (given that all sellers speak better than the consumers) or do so probabilistically, this makes this model one of a horizontal distribution in terms of the consumers. The equilibrium of the model will be determined by the hypothesis that less sophisticated consumers are matched with poor experts. In the dynamic model, the language rules are no longer fixed, with mutations on words and grammar, in an evolutionary model. The hypothesis then is whether, over time, a specialized language is meant as a barrier for consumers to counter the experts’ incentives for fraud. The model can be extended from a single dimension of language proficiency to a bilingual environment, making this a two-dimensional problem with added complexity. The roles of intermediaries as those consumers with a ‘working knowledge’ of the language through experience would be pivotal in search efficiency.</p>\\n<p><strong>CAN NO KNOWLEDGE BE BETTER THAN SOME KNOWLEDGE IN THE MARKET?</strong></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 3\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>Before I started the practice, a mountain was a mountain and a river was a river.

This builds on the idea that language doesn’t just express thought, rather constitutes it. This paper formalizes de Saussure’s (1916) conception of the syntagm and the paradigm and concords it with Shannon’s (1948) theory of valence. The intuition is that what differentiates a formal language and a natural language, where the former is projected in terms of the latter is that it is more ‘precise’ in its vocabulary and grammar rules, that is the number of referents a word has is reduced and is usually one. Such a formal language becomes binding on the combinatorial possibilities of words to form sentences, and parallel conception in the ontological space means a ‘narrow outlook’ of the world. This is of course not true for all the experts of that formal language, but for the beginners. For example, a layman is not constrained in the speculations of his observations say in light of the economic crisis (whether he is right or wrong), but for an economics undergraduate who has training in basic economics (colloquially termed Economics 101), would not only try to fix the crisis in the mould of his training, but would rather be confident about it. But for a veteran economic theorist can invent new rules to explain the crisis, guided by experience and knowledge. The formalization of this hypothesis is the object of the second paper.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 3\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>The formalization of this idea can be applied in varied ways, one of which relates to the previous paper on the market for expert services. The mechanisms of this are that the naïve consumer matching with automatically the busiest expert while the slightly more informed trusts his judgment which within a ‘lemons market’ scenario can prove disastrous. The second mechanism is that in the interaction process with the expert, given that the expert gets the signal to put more effort in forming the interpretable linguistic message but for the intermediate, the expert sends a precise message in the market language which the intermediate might not interpret. This can be formalized using the wisdom and technical definitions in terms of language as mapped out in the first section. In a flexible grammar approach, training does not imply wisdom. So the knowledge of grammar doesn’t mean its usage and a complex signal hence wouldn’t be interpreted in the duration of the interaction.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>FOOTNOTE &#8211;  1. </strong></em>I prefer to use the term ‘rationally ignorant’ or ‘rationally submissive’</p>\\n<p>2. We can assume technical training provides wisdom although at a fractional increase compared with experience.</p></blockquote>\\n<p><strong>VAGUENESS AND PRECISION</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 4\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>Economic interactions and transactions are expressed through natural language which as has been established is vague. Lipman (2006) provides an excellent study of whether being vague than precise is ‘monotonically bad’. The answer is obviously no. Depending on context, the interacting agents, and other factors, vague language cannot only precisely transmit information in lesser effort, but can bypass rules to present a simplified approximation of the complex information signal. (For example, metaphors and analogies). However, the simplification of language in sense of Ockham’s razor (Say a popular book on Quantum Physics for the mass market), definitely has strategic considerations, or as Crawford and Sobel propose that partitioning can reveal an informative equilibrium in cheap talk. These issues apply to how language is used, that is concerns Pragmatics. Since each word in a vocabulary ascribes a network of meanings, usually correlated with one another4. With all these points under consideration, and factors such as the costs of precision, strategic considerations and the linguistic model described above, a strategic information transmission of the spirit of Crawford and Sobel(1982) would be studied under natural language interpretation of message states, in what Lipman(2006) conjectured for the ideal bounded rational study of vagueness.</p>\\n<p><strong>THE BILINGUAL GAME</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 4\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>This essay provides a theoretical reasoning of why some natural languages fair better amongst others in terms of the market language. Suppose if L is the language of economic agents, representing concepts in the totality of factual and counterfactuals of its sentences, and two natural languages say English(E) and French(F). The question is whether the two languages can equally project L? These two languages should fulfill some base requirements, that is to describe the ontologies of the real world in the dictionary sense. Once both languages fulfill the criteria, then the hypothesis can be tested. The intuition is that L can then be projected in both E and F, but once the rules and vocabulary are not fixed, the use of the language would mean that L will itself change(mutate) in the long run, where the frequency of use of L in terms of E or F will determine the mutation. Since L is expressed in natural language, new concepts in L would emerge in the natural language of E. So that in the conversation between E and F, the speaker of E would be better able to communicate L, rather than F who would then have to learn E apart from L in terms of F. This paper outlines the social dimension of language and pragmatics. This paper would be in similar lines in the idea to the one by Lang(1986) who uses a transaction costs approach and not an informational one to show how a language can be discriminatory.<br />\\nOther games and ideas such as the Chinese Whispers game of message distortion over multiple agents transmission, the problem of information cascades and herd behavior and linguistic analysis, and other questions would be considered as avenues for further research.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>FOOTNOTE &#8211; </strong></em>Wittgenstein(1953) called these Family Resemblances</p></blockquote>\\n<p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\" title=\\\"Page 5\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"layoutArea\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"column\\\">\\n<p>RABIN, M.

The latter means it is flexible enough to absorb elements from other sciences and social sciences, which has already become apparent in the fields of Evolutionary Biology, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and the focus of the dissertation, Information Theory and Linguistics (including Philosophy of Language). This intermingling of disciplines makes both fields better off, where linguists can take advantage of strategic interaction, optimality, and efficiency results while we can incorporate theories of communication and language from them. It is my personal opinion that the world is offered to us as it is, the fields are artificially constructed and in their rigidity, we miss out on some potentially important discoveries. It is with an optimistic observation of seeing the walls among disciplines break, that has inspired me to work on a dissertation across disciplines.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Language is the mechanism through which humans communicate. Without some form of Language, no interaction at the present scale of economic affairs would have been conceivable. Not only do we communicate in language, but we also think and learn in terms of language (Whorf – 1956; Wittgenstein – 1921). Economics despite its affirmation as the ‘Queen of Social Sciences’ has neglected to delve into linguistic effects on economic behavior. The Present treatment of communication has also been fairly recent, with Spence’s theory of costly signaling, and game theoretic models of costless signaling, after the seminal work of Crawford and Sobel (1982) and follow up literature dubbed as Cheap Talk games. The framework of these games have their roots in Lewis’ Sender-Receiver games (1969) where the sender observes a state, sends a message, the receiver takes the action conditional on the message which affects both their payoffs. Many leading economists as well as from the outside have voiced concerns of treating communication among humans in a model of ‘Animal Communication’ (Lipman – 2009; Rubinstein – 2000) the primary argument of which is that such games are mostly concerned with the strategies associated with a message rather than the content of the message which under a linguistic signal can have varying effects apart from what the papers suggest.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>With the aforementioned motivations in mind, my dissertation would be a compilation of essays on classic problems of Microeconomic theory with language as the mode of analysis. Since Language and Linguistics are as broad a field as Economics and deals with subject matters relating to Speech Patterns, Etymology, Sociolinguistics, it is to be made clear at the outset that before such an analysis, a theory needs to be established to make concepts from such theories amenable to economic analysis. This means two things: &#8211;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1. Language, as studied in ‘Language and Economics’ domain under cultural and social economics, a survey for which is given by Grin (2009), deals with sociolinguistic aspects of language in economic life, for example, differential wages of Francophones and Anglophones. However, the treatment of language in my dissertation would be a complete abstraction of language, drawn from linguistic philosophy to conceive of a language which can refer to a natural language, an artificial language, or even a nonexistent language abstraction, as the analysis deems fit.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2. Though my proposed dissertation is closer in spirit to Marshack (1965) and Rubinstein (2000), who have tried to analyze aspects of Language efficiency and analysis through economic methods, it is not what my dissertation proposes to study. The work which is closest to my objectives is “Is Language vague” (Lipman, 2009), but as discussed above, it provides a framework developed in the style of Cheap Talk literature, and itself concludes that the quirks of linguistic effects on information transmission can at best be studied within a boundedly rational model.</p>\n<p><strong>DISSERTATION OUTLINE</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The first section of the dissertation would outline aspects from linguistic theory to define an abstract conception of language, and how it relates to notions of data, information, knowledge, technical proficiency, wisdom and practical usage. It will elucidate how language can treat these processes relatively to signaling theory. For a formalization of language, it is imperative to be aware that this is not an end but a means to study market outcomes and behavior, and hence only aspects of linguistics which are general and applicable would be used for analysis. Philosophy of language is useful in this aspect, particularly those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, notwithstanding some of the most insightful views of language but also because his work transitioned from a purely logical conception of language in his early work (Wittgenstein &#8211; 1922 ), to the strict rejection and more naturalistic view of it in his later work (Wittgenstein &#8211; 1953). The formalization of the two models would provide us with the option of comparing statics to providing a dynamic model of language evolution1 from the former to the latter, and its welfare effects on the market participants. Other aspects of Language philosophy and Linguistics would be borrowed from the works of Pierce, de Saussure, Chomsky, Frege, Russell, and others to create a simple but hybrid conception of language which embodies information and knowledge within its structure.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>After the conception of a linguistic model for economic agents, the dissertation will apply it to three classic problems in Information Economics literature (though other fields are not yet excluded). The following sections will cover each of these.</p>\n<p><strong>THE MARKET FOR EXPERT SERVICES</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Certain markets for expert services such as for medical treatment, legal consultation, car repair, financial services etc. pose problems on account of the large information asymmetries between the sellers(experts) and the consumers. Darby and Karni(1973) labeled them as Credence Good markets, where unlike experience goods, the quality and quantity of treatment cannot be verified even post-transaction. Dulleck and Kerschbamer(2006) in their analysis and survey of articles pertaining to such literature point out that price signals fail to transmit information about the parameters and tend to be flat among poor and good experts alike. The Experts can take advantage of the information gap and hence are incentivized to deceive particularly the less sophisticated or naïve buyers.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>While Dulleck and Kerschbamer(2006) do suggest that to minimize the probability of being deceived, one has to end up choosing the busiest or an expert who charges a premium, they do not account for that when experts do have a capacity constraint, their incentive for putting less effort per consumer increases. In fact, as has been empirically shown in health markets of developing countries where public hospitals can at most give 3.2 minutes on average per patient (Das et al, 2008).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>FOOTNOTE &#8211; </strong>Language here would be defined as a ‘market language’ – An abstraction which assumes that if the analysis is of a market, then the world is divided into two ontologies, where each ontology would be described by a language. So for the real world which encompasses the Economic world a natural language – English, and for the participants of the market, a language which describes their ontology better than the vague natural language. We will call this language “Oikos”. It is important to note here that “</em>oikos<em>” is a specialized language projected in the natural language. For e.g. The word Equilibrium exists both in real ontology and Economic ontology – but might mean completely different things in each specification.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The first essay proposes to analyze such markets where I assume that all market participants (buyers, sellers, intermediaries) are distributed spatially according to their proficiency in that market’s language. So if L is the market language, the market participants are identified on the basis of their endowment of L in the static game. The experts are assumed to be ‘trained with certification’ and the only way agents can learn the language is by experience. The spatial distribution makes this model one with vertical differentiation, but since the consumers cannot distinguish the seller’s type (given that all sellers speak better than the consumers) or do so probabilistically, this makes this model one of a horizontal distribution in terms of the consumers. The equilibrium of the model will be determined by the hypothesis that less sophisticated consumers are matched with poor experts. In the dynamic model, the language rules are no longer fixed, with mutations on words and grammar, in an evolutionary model. The hypothesis then is whether, over time, a specialized language is meant as a barrier for consumers to counter the experts’ incentives for fraud. The model can be extended from a single dimension of language proficiency to a bilingual environment, making this a two-dimensional problem with added complexity. The roles of intermediaries as those consumers with a ‘working knowledge’ of the language through experience would be pivotal in search efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>CAN NO KNOWLEDGE BE BETTER THAN SOME KNOWLEDGE IN THE MARKET?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Before I started the practice, a mountain was a mountain and a river was a river. When I was deep into the practice, the mountain was no longer a mountain and river was no longer a river.

This builds on the idea that language doesn’t just express thought, rather constitutes it. This paper formalizes de Saussure’s (1916) conception of the syntagm and the paradigm and concords it with Shannon’s (1948) theory of valence. The intuition is that what differentiates a formal language and a natural language, where the former is projected in terms of the latter is that it is more ‘precise’ in its vocabulary and grammar rules, that is the number of referents a word has is reduced and is usually one. Such a formal language becomes binding on the combinatorial possibilities of words to form sentences, and parallel conception in the ontological space means a ‘narrow outlook’ of the world. This is of course not true for all the experts of that formal language, but for the beginners. For example, a layman is not constrained in the speculations of his observations say in light of the economic crisis (whether he is right or wrong), but for an economics undergraduate who has training in basic economics (colloquially termed Economics 101), would not only try to fix the crisis in the mould of his training, but would rather be confident about it. But for a veteran economic theorist can invent new rules to explain the crisis, guided by experience and knowledge. The formalization of this hypothesis is the object of the second paper.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The formalization of this idea can be applied in varied ways, one of which relates to the previous paper on the market for expert services. The mechanisms of this are that the naïve consumer matching with automatically the busiest expert while the slightly more informed trusts his judgment which within a ‘lemons market’ scenario can prove disastrous. The second mechanism is that in the interaction process with the expert, given that the expert gets the signal to put more effort in forming the interpretable linguistic message but for the intermediate, the expert sends a precise message in the market language which the intermediate might not interpret. This can be formalized using the wisdom and technical definitions in terms of language as mapped out in the first section. In a flexible grammar approach, training does not imply wisdom. So the knowledge of grammar doesn’t mean its usage and a complex signal hence wouldn’t be interpreted in the duration of the interaction.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>FOOTNOTE &#8211;  1. </strong></em>I prefer to use the term ‘rationally ignorant’ or ‘rationally submissive’</p>\n<p>2. We can assume technical training provides wisdom although at a fractional increase compared with experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>VAGUENESS AND PRECISION</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Economic interactions and transactions are expressed through natural language which as has been established is vague. Lipman (2006) provides an excellent study of whether being vague than precise is ‘monotonically bad’. The answer is obviously no. Depending on context, the interacting agents, and other factors, vague language cannot only precisely transmit information in lesser effort, but can bypass rules to present a simplified approximation of the complex information signal. (For example, metaphors and analogies). However, the simplification of language in sense of Ockham’s razor (Say a popular book on Quantum Physics for the mass market), definitely has strategic considerations, or as Crawford and Sobel propose that partitioning can reveal an informative equilibrium in cheap talk. These issues apply to how language is used, that is concerns Pragmatics. Since each word in a vocabulary ascribes a network of meanings, usually correlated with one another4. With all these points under consideration, and factors such as the costs of precision, strategic considerations and the linguistic model described above, a strategic information transmission of the spirit of Crawford and Sobel(1982) would be studied under natural language interpretation of message states, in what Lipman(2006) conjectured for the ideal bounded rational study of vagueness.</p>\n<p><strong>THE BILINGUAL GAME</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>This essay provides a theoretical reasoning of why some natural languages fair better amongst others in terms of the market language. Suppose if L is the language of economic agents, representing concepts in the totality of factual and counterfactuals of its sentences, and two natural languages say English(E) and French(F). The question is whether the two languages can equally project L? These two languages should fulfill some base requirements, that is to describe the ontologies of the real world in the dictionary sense. Once both languages fulfill the criteria, then the hypothesis can be tested. The intuition is that L can then be projected in both E and F, but once the rules and vocabulary are not fixed, the use of the language would mean that L will itself change(mutate) in the long run, where the frequency of use of L in terms of E or F will determine the mutation. Since L is expressed in natural language, new concepts in L would emerge in the natural language of E. So that in the conversation between E and F, the speaker of E would be better able to communicate L, rather than F who would then have to learn E apart from L in terms of F. This paper outlines the social dimension of language and pragmatics. This paper would be in similar lines in the idea to the one by Lang(1986) who uses a transaction costs approach and not an informational one to show how a language can be discriminatory.<br />\nOther games and ideas such as the Chinese Whispers game of message distortion over multiple agents transmission, the problem of information cascades and herd behavior and linguistic analysis, and other questions would be considered as avenues for further research.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>FOOTNOTE &#8211; </strong></em>Wittgenstein(1953) called these Family Resemblances</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>RABIN, M.

The following sections will cover\neach of these.\n\nTHE MARKET FOR EXPERT SERVICES\n\nCertain markets for expert services such as for medical treatment, legal\nconsultation, car repair, financial services etc. pose problems on account of\nthe large information asymmetries between the sellers(experts) and the\nconsumers. Darby and Karni(1973) labeled them as Credence Good markets, where\nunlike experience goods, the quality and quantity of treatment cannot be\nverified even post-transaction.

In\nfact, as has been empirically shown in health markets of developing countries\nwhere public hospitals can at most give 3.2 minutes on average per patient (Das\net al, 2008).\n\n\n\n> FOOTNOTE –Language here would be defined as a ‘market language’ – An abstraction\nwhich assumes that if the analysis is of a market, then the world is divided\ninto two ontologies, where each ontology would be described by a language. So\nfor the real world which encompasses the Economic world a natural language –\nEnglish, and for the participants of the market, a language which describes\ntheir ontology better than the vague natural language. We will call this\nlanguage “Oikos”. It is important to note here that “oikos” is a specialized\nlanguage projected in the natural language. For e.g. The word Equilibrium exists\nboth in real ontology and Economic ontology – but might mean completely\ndifferent things in each specification.\n\n\n\n\nThe first essay proposes to analyze such markets where I assume that all market\nparticipants (buyers, sellers, intermediaries) are distributed spatially\naccording to their proficiency in that market’s language. So if L is the market\nlanguage, the market participants are identified on the basis of their endowment\nof L in the static game. The experts are assumed to be ‘trained with\ncertification’ and the only way agents can learn the language is by experience.\nThe spatial distribution makes this model one with vertical differentiation, but\nsince the consumers cannot distinguish the seller’s type (given that all sellers\nspeak better than the consumers) or do so probabilistically, this makes this\nmodel one of a horizontal distribution in terms of the consumers. The\nequilibrium of the model will be determined by the hypothesis that less\nsophisticated consumers are matched with poor experts. In the dynamic model, the\nlanguage rules are no longer fixed, with mutations on words and grammar, in an\nevolutionary model. The hypothesis then is whether, over time, a specialized\nlanguage is meant as a barrier for consumers to counter the experts’ incentives\nfor fraud. The model can be extended from a single dimension of language\nproficiency to a bilingual environment, making this a two-dimensional problem\nwith added complexity. The roles of intermediaries as those consumers with a\n‘working knowledge’ of the language through experience would be pivotal in\nsearch efficiency.\n\nCAN NO KNOWLEDGE BE BETTER THAN SOME KNOWLEDGE IN THE MARKET?\n\n> Before I started the practice, a mountain was a mountain and a river was a\nriver. When I was deep into the practice, the mountain was no longer a mountain\nand river was no longer a river. Now that I have mastered the practice, a\nmountain is a mountain, and a river is a river.\n\n-Buddhist Zen Koan\n\n\nThis paper applies the classic Whorfian hypothesis of the causal relationship\nbetween language and thought which was earlier stated by Wittgenstein\naphoristically as “The Limits of my language means the limits of my world”\n(Wittgenstein – 1922:5.6). This builds on the idea that language doesn’t just\nexpress thought, rather constitutes it. This paper formalizes de Saussure’s\n(1916) conception of the syntagm and the paradigm and concords it with Shannon’s\n(1948) theory of valence. The intuition is that what differentiates a formal\nlanguage and a natural language, where the former is projected in terms of the\nlatter is that it is more ‘precise’ in its vocabulary and grammar rules, that is\nthe number of referents a word has is reduced and is usually one. Such a formal\nlanguage becomes binding on the combinatorial possibilities of words to form\nsentences, and parallel conception in the ontological space means a ‘narrow\noutlook’ of the world. This is of course not true for all the experts of that\nformal language, but for the beginners. For example, a layman is not constrained\nin the speculations of his observations say in light of the economic crisis\n(whether he is right or wrong), but for an economics undergraduate who has\ntraining in basic economics (colloquially termed Economics 101), would not only\ntry to fix the crisis in the mould of his training, but would rather be\nconfident about it. But for a veteran economic theorist can invent new rules to\nexplain the crisis, guided by experience and knowledge. The formalization of\nthis hypothesis is the object of the second paper.\n\nThe formalization of this idea can be applied in varied ways, one of which\nrelates to the previous paper on the market for expert services. The mechanisms\nof this are that the naïve consumer matching with automatically the busiest\nexpert while the slightly more informed trusts his judgment which within a\n‘lemons market’ scenario can prove disastrous. The second mechanism is that in\nthe interaction process with the expert, given that the expert gets the signal\nto put more effort in forming the interpretable linguistic message but for the\nintermediate, the expert sends a precise message in the market language which\nthe intermediate might not interpret. This can be formalized using the wisdom\nand technical definitions in terms of language as mapped out in the first\nsection. In a flexible grammar approach, training does not imply wisdom. So the\nknowledge of grammar doesn’t mean its usage and a complex signal hence wouldn’t\nbe interpreted in the duration of the interaction.\n\n> FOOTNOTE –  1.I prefer to use the term ‘rationally ignorant’ or ‘rationally\nsubmissive’\n\n2. We can assume technical training provides wisdom although at a fractional\nincrease compared with experience.\n\n\nVAGUENESS AND PRECISION\n\nEconomic interactions and transactions are expressed through natural language\nwhich as has been established is vague. Lipman (2006) provides an excellent\nstudy of whether being vague than precise is ‘monotonically bad’. The answer is\nobviously no. Depending on context, the interacting agents, and other factors,\nvague language cannot only precisely transmit information in lesser effort, but\ncan bypass rules to present a simplified approximation of the complex\ninformation signal. (For example, metaphors and analogies). However, the\nsimplification of language in sense of Ockham’s razor (Say a popular book on\nQuantum Physics for the mass market), definitely has strategic considerations,\nor as Crawford and Sobel propose that partitioning can reveal an informative\nequilibrium in cheap talk. These issues apply to how language is used, that is\nconcerns Pragmatics. Since each word in a vocabulary ascribes a network of\nmeanings, usually correlated with one another4. With all these points under\nconsideration, and factors such as the costs of precision, strategic\nconsiderations and the linguistic model described above, a strategic information\ntransmission of the spirit of Crawford and Sobel(1982) would be studied under\nnatural language interpretation of message states, in what Lipman(2006)\nconjectured for the ideal bounded rational study of vagueness.\n\nTHE BILINGUAL GAME\n\nThis essay provides a theoretical reasoning of why some natural languages fair\nbetter amongst others in terms of the market language. Suppose if L is the\nlanguage of economic agents, representing concepts in the totality of factual\nand counterfactuals of its sentences, and two natural languages say English(E)\nand French(F). The question is whether the two languages can equally project L?\nThese two languages should fulfill some base requirements, that is to describe\nthe ontologies of the real world in the dictionary sense. Once both languages\nfulfill the criteria, then the hypothesis can be tested. The intuition is that L\ncan then be projected in both E and F, but once the rules and vocabulary are not\nfixed, the use of the language would mean that L will itself change(mutate) in\nthe long run, where the frequency of use of L in terms of E or F will determine\nthe mutation. Since L is expressed in natural language, new concepts in L would\nemerge in the natural language of E. So that in the conversation between E and\nF, the speaker of E would be better able to communicate L, rather than F who\nwould then have to learn E apart from L in terms of F. This paper outlines the\nsocial dimension of language and pragmatics. This paper would be in similar\nlines in the idea to the one by Lang(1986) who uses a transaction costs approach\nand not an informational one to show how a language can be discriminatory.\nOther games and ideas such as the Chinese Whispers game of message distortion\nover multiple agents transmission, the problem of information cascades and herd\nbehavior and linguistic analysis, and other questions would be considered as\navenues for further research.\n\n> FOOTNOTE –Wittgenstein(1953) called these Family Resemblances\n\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nRABIN, M.

With regards to the content of the previous post, I am glad to reveal that my Ph.D. proposal was modified to be more grounded in mainstream economic theory, but retained the spirit of the exercise and hence left my faculty, my advisory committee and myself, better off. I have since submerged in getting back to intensive reading everything that was not related to my research but finally composed myself to start on my thesis, to be presented in three years from today ideally.</p>\\n<p>I, however, am glad though the absence from the blogosphere made me guilty, I am back with perhaps the most ambitious post to date, for I have lost my philosophical virginity to Immanuel Kant, the greatest and one of the most difficult philosophers to have existed, and have finished two-thirds of his writings and have made copious notes, and fairly confident of having understood his works somewhat. The present post outlines Kant&#8217;s ethical theory, from his celebrated &#8216;<strong>Groundwork for Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals</strong>&#8216;(yeah try saying that 5 times!)</p>\\n<p>It is important to note that this is a purely theoretical exercise, and even if you agree with the system or not, take it as a piece of art at the least, and something to think about at the most. I have tried to be lucid and precise, however, I yet lack the skills to interpret his work well enough to explain like you&#8217;re five, and it is going to be a somewhat long post, but I request you to save it or bookmark it, and really stick with it because a) I have spent a lot of time in extracting Kant&#8217;s thought from a very dense book. b) It would be worthwhile at least as an entry to perhaps without question one of the greatest thinkers to have ever lived. And now, we shall start in our endeavor.</p>\\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> &#8211; Please don&#8217;t focus on the use of pronouns as I&#8217;ve used man as the mode of analysis, out of convenience since I have a penis and think like a male.</p>\\n<h1><strong>Of Good, Evil and all that Jazz- A Case for Objective Morality by Immanuel Kant</strong></h1>\\n<p>There is a fine distinction between Natural Science and Social Science, for, in the world of natural science, we use our senses to interpret external objects, that is, while we can be sure that there is a tree in front of us, we are limited by the resolution of our eyes to interpret what our brain shows us of the tree. An animal with far stronger eyesight might see a shade of colors unfathomable to us, thereby seeing a truer picture of the reality, but we can’t be sure that anything can grasp the true nature of any object, say, except for a perfect omniscient being, let us call it God.</p>\\n<p>Social Science, however, is different. Let’s start with the basis of all social science – Ethics. Why? Well, it is the foundation on which the premise of a civilization rests. The acknowledgment of principles of right and wrong is the source of Law and Justice. Politics and Economics derive from the interpretation of right, wrong; pleasure and pain which we derive from? Well &#8211; Ethics. It is bad to hurt another person can be within one&#8217;s conscience, but as a law means doing so would incur punishment formally. Ethics can these days be seen in a more metaphysical light thanks to anticipated developments in the not so distant future.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><strong>Suppose you design artificial intelligence and have to program an ethical system for the machine to follow. Would you want it to statistically emulate humans? I hope not. Humans would go extinct in a year. How to then program ethics into an intelligent machine, such that within the scope of a free will, the machines still make choices under the logical system supplanted by us, and which would not get us annihilated?</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Ethics is a construction of human thought(or is it?) Unlike objects which can never be known in their true form because we are limited by sense, we can create an imagined world which has every property carefully laid out by us. To do so, we need to create a theory that is independent of all actual experience(No empirical observations, say when designing that machine.) Can we do that? How do we do that? <strong>Kant did that</strong>. And he did it pretty well. But the result is something that we would probably be underwhelmed with. The generality of theory to make it independent from all facets of how humans actually live makes it somewhat restrictive. But it’s not the result but the accomplishment of the construction of such a system that is important here. And so we start-</p>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\"><strong>THE RECIPE OF OBJECTIVE MORALITY</strong></span></h3>\\n<p>We start with the first axiom &#8211;  <strong>Agency or </strong><strong>Free Will</strong> <em>(Remember this because it’s important in the last section)</em></p>\\n<p>Humans can make choices and can deliberately choose to not choose something just because well, they can. Nature has granted humans with two devices to take actions – <strong>Instinct and Reason</strong>. Instinct acts on two principles – Pleasure and Pain. Instinct is like an internal command, which may or may not be reasonable. (<em>In fact, Daniel Kahneman has worked out the various cognitive biases inherent in instinctual actions, what we now call heuristics in modern psychology</em>)</p>\\n<p>We seek things which provide pleasure and avoid things which cause pain. (<em>This is the starting point of utilitarian theory</em>). However, man can transcend and negate instincts. He can avoid immediate pleasure with a view that abstaining from such pleasure might benefit his health or yield future dividends. This higher faculty is that of <strong>Reason </strong>and is, to a degree, unique to humans. As individual humans are different in their biology, cultures, and dispositions, how do we abstract humanity to a homogeneous whole? Well, Reason. When properly applied, logical reasoning should deduce fixed conclusions from a set of premises.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><strong>The Faculty of Reason, in other words, is universal in all Rational Beings.</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Reason</strong> stands above <strong>I</strong><strong>nstinct</strong> since it can validate instinctual actions but not vice versa. The faculty of reason is what separates us from the animal, for instinctual actions occur in both. Just as Science is not necessary for humans to live but can indeed be used as a faculty to make life convenient and better, Reason, similarly, is a powerful faculty for us to make civilization possible.</p>\\n<p>So to start, we have <strong>Free Will </strong>as an axiom and <strong>Reason </strong>as the optimum faculty to take actions, we can proceed towards an <strong>Ethical Theory.</strong> A theory starts with definitions, and the first and foremost definition we require is that of a  <strong>Good Action</strong>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"> Kant defines <em><strong>Good</strong> as <strong>Goodness-in-itself</strong></em>. (Ha! but let me explain)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">Though there can be possibly many virtues(intelligence, patience etc.,), they lose their essence when used as means towards some goal. Say donation of wealth to save taxes or raise one&#8217;s position in society. The <strong>Good Will</strong> is the only source of moral value. But we still haven&#8217;t defined the <strong>Good Will</strong>, and shall proceed towards that.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><em>Many consider stoic living or frugality to be a virtue, but is it though? Moderation or detachment can be attributes of evil(Michael Corleone comes to mind)</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\"><strong>DUTY AS THE &#8220;GOOD&#8221; WILL</strong></span></h3>\\n<p>The Human Will exercises judgment through three methods: &#8211; <strong>Self Interest, Inclinations, and Duty.</strong> Those who have studied economics can understand it in terms of the utility approach(<em>Kantian ethics are opposed to Utilitarianism- I use it just for easier exposition</em>)</p>\\n<p>Suppose we take a <strong>good action</strong> – say philanthropy is <strong>good</strong>. For some, what matters is that the deed was done, but not so for Kant.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><em>If an act of charity is done in expectation of recognition or to save taxes, then it is an action borne out of <strong>self-interest</strong>. For Kant, this doesn’t entail moral worth since the person doing the action is deriving value directly out of it.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Suppose that the philanthropic action is done not from <strong>self-interest, </strong>but simply because it makes one happy. For Kant, even such actions don’t entail objective moral worth, since it is done out of an individual&#8217;s <strong>inclinations or preferences</strong>. An example would drive the argument better:-</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Let there be two persons A and B where B derives happiness from donating food, while A does not. Suppose A and B then both perform the philanthropic deed. For the utilitarian, there’s no difference in the actions of A and B, but for Kant, the action was easier for B since he derives happiness from it, the total value of the deed goes to his utility function, and the rest as say moral value. For A instead, who doesn’t derive any happiness from the deed, the value from action doesn&#8217;t exist as individual utility, but solely as moral value. Thus A has done something more moral than B in performing the same action.</p></blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><strong><em>Hence, Duty is the sole generator of moral value, for if done by actions of preference or self-interest would not be objective, as preferences vary among people, and then the only outcome to generate objective moral value is not to see the actions as a means to happiness, but rather the action itself, even if it provides discomfort, so that one need not even consider utility concerns when taking certain actions.</em></strong></p>\\n<p>Here, two clarifications are required:-</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>There might be objections that since Kant started with  Free Will, then isn&#8217;t a <strong>binding duty</strong> self-contradictory?</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Kant answers that though the will must indeed submit to duty, the will does so <em>willingly </em>i.e. out of respect since the rational will acknowledges that such duty transcends the will so that any rational person can determine the sanctity of a duty through the application of transparent reason.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>What if the laws and duties represent the self-interest of the legislator?</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The answer to this question is the focus of the next section and introduction of the crux of Kant&#8217;s system &#8211; <strong>The Categorical Imperative.</strong></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\">THE LEGISLATION OF LAWS/DUTIES</span></h3>\\n<p>It would be prudent to start with a definition.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em>A <strong>M</strong><strong>axim</strong> is any principle an individual might consider to be <strong>good</strong>. Once a maxim passes <strong>Kant’s criterion of legislation</strong> it can hence be enacted as a <strong>L</strong><strong>aw.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>Take any maxim, say a person believing that <strong>white lies</strong> to be <strong>good</strong>. Can such a maxim be objectively good? Surely not. A way to test it is through the <em><strong>Principle of Universality(Kant&#8217;s criterion) &#8211; </strong></em></p>\\n<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s suppose that the maxim of <strong>white lies </strong>is a universal law to which every person is subject. Is it <strong>good? </strong>It would then imply that even the government could lie to its people whose duty then is to &#8220;protect people&#8221; by lying about policy enactments. But this is a logical contradiction since the only cause to lie would be <strong>as a means</strong> to protect its own interests rather than as <strong>a good-in-itself.</strong></p></blockquote>\\n<p>It is hence stated as thus:-</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em>Any individual maxim which is <strong>not</strong> a universally applicable as a <strong>law</strong> must contradict itself . </em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>When is a maxim then applicable as a law? For Kant, only when it is <strong>categorical.</strong></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\"><strong>THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE and THE KINGDOM OF ENDS</strong></span></h4>\\n<p>An imperative or a command can either be <strong>Hypothetical(Conditional) </strong>or <strong>Categorical(Unconditional). </strong></p>\\n<p>So if the command is – <em><strong>You shall not lie</strong></em>, it is non-contingent, and a universal principle, but however if the command is &#8211; <em><strong>You shall not lie for lest it destroy your credibility</strong></em>, the maxim is then conditional. The difference between both is that while the first holds <strong>value in itself</strong>, that is not lying, the second derives <strong>value as a means to something</strong>, that is, credibility. So even if the action is the same, that is not lying, the moral worth of the first is clearly more than the second, and while the first principle is applicable universally and hence objective, the second applies to the subject in question.</p>\\n<p>Law within a society could arise from divine, sovereign, or through modern democratic sources. The legislator can issue commands for his own self-interest, but if the law is categorical and not hypothetical, two things prevent such a happening.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The legislator himself then must be the object of the law, which prevents him from creating exigencies through which he could create exceptions possible only in the Hypothetical imperative.</li>\\n<li>Self-interest can still manifest itself in categorical imperative when universal commands still serve the interests of the legislators. However, the only solution to such a problem is Kant&#8217;s final solution, stated as follows:-</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote><p> <em><strong>The Universal Law(The Categorical Imperative) can only be realized when Man is viewed as an end-in-himself.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>What does Kant mean when he says that every rational human is an end in itself? He means that any law which aims at maximization of social welfare cannot use humans as means towards such a goal, because human welfare is exactly the goal of such a law. A ruler using slavery as a means to achieve economic progress contradicts this principle even if the country benefits through rapid development and might increase overall social utility. This is better illustrated in the following example:-</p>\\n<p>When humans are ends-in-themselves, a person’s utility should come from the increase in utility of the other in the same proportion. That is:-</p>\\n<blockquote><p><strong>U(A/[AB]) = U(A/[AA]) = U(B/[BA]) = U(B/[BB]) {Here &#8220;/&#8221; signifies given or &#8220;if&#8221; &#8211; interpreted as utility to A from an action of A to B should be equal to utility to A when he does an action for himself &#8211; Note that this is only applicable for &#8220;Duties&#8221; or &#8220;Laws&#8221; and not all actions or moral principles &#8211; Moral Laws can be imagined as Fundamental Rights as maxims.) </strong></p></blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Since the increase(decrease) in A’s utility from an action means the increase(decrease) in B’s utility from the same action, this satisfies Kan’ts criterion as a universal law of nature which is the categorical imperative.</strong> Now when we remove utility from this system such that it is a law bound by duty, which the rational will can ascertain, we are left with pure moral worth maximization. (of course inclinations, in reality, do differ, but when everything is determined by law, inclinations don’t really matter, as they introduce subjectivity into an objective system). The above final proof may seem convoluted but it has remarkably intuitive implications. This sums up Kant&#8217;s entire moral theory.</p>\\n<h3></h3>\\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>At the most basic level, as pure humans, all humans hold the same intrinsic value, regardless of social status or skills, which can add market value or fancy value over and above the absolute intrinsic value.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>All rational beings are equal by law. This includes the legislator of laws who must be equally subject to the laws for the system to be consistent.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\">IS ETHICS REAL OR A CONSTRUCT OF OUR BRAINS?</span></h3>\\n<p>If you remember from the first section, we started with <strong>Free Will</strong> as the only axiom. That is the entire theory is contingent on that axiom through which Kant proceeded with his ethical system. Now Kant prepares us for the <em>Grand Finale</em>.</p>\\n<p>Kant now shows that if this axiom is a <strong>truth</strong>, the whole system would become real and independent purely constituted from <strong>Reason</strong>. <strong>Free Will</strong> is tautological with the <strong>autonomy of the will. </strong>Kant argues that <strong>Free Will cannot be an assumption which we start with</strong> since it’s a necessary truth. In ignoring the affectations of senses in forming our morality and starting the system from reason itself is an act of free will, through which we uncover the concept of freedom as well.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>The will doesn’t define freedom but exercises it. Without freedom there is no will. Without a will there is no freedom.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\\n<p>The faculty of creating an intelligible world through the application of reason to the will is what Kant terms ‘<strong>Practical Reason</strong>’ as opposed to the faculty of ‘<strong>Pure Reason</strong>’ applied in understanding our external world.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Ethics as opposed to Metaphysics of Nature starts with the Subject creating the Object and can hence know its reality in full. Here, in theory, we are Gods and hence understand the objects for we are the ones who have designed it. In nature, the object stands apart from us, We start with the object and attempt to understand it, while in ethics, understanding precedes the object of our exercise.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>Now that Freedom is real, what causes Freedom of the Will to arise? That is a question best left to the scientists, and not the philosopher since philosophy can only go so far to prove that it exists and is real, but not how it came to be&#8230;</p>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure id=\"attachment_130\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-130\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-130\" src=\"https://boundedlyirrational.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kant_360x450.jpg\" alt=\"kant_360x450\" width=\"360\" height=\"450\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-130\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Immanuel Kant to the artist &#8211; &#8220;Paintshop ya hear me, for the bitches ya meen?&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It has been three months since my previous post.

And so we start-</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>THE RECIPE OF OBJECTIVE MORALITY</strong></span></h3>\n<p>We start with the first axiom &#8211;  <strong>Agency or </strong><strong>Free Will</strong> <em>(Remember this because it’s important in the last section)</em></p>\n<p>Humans can make choices and can deliberately choose to not choose something just because well, they can. Nature has granted humans with two devices to take actions – <strong>Instinct and Reason</strong>. Instinct acts on two principles – Pleasure and Pain. Instinct is like an internal command, which may or may not be reasonable. (<em>In fact, Daniel Kahneman has worked out the various cognitive biases inherent in instinctual actions, what we now call heuristics in modern psychology</em>)</p>\n<p>We seek things which provide pleasure and avoid things which cause pain. (<em>This is the starting point of utilitarian theory</em>). However, man can transcend and negate instincts. He can avoid immediate pleasure with a view that abstaining from such pleasure might benefit his health or yield future dividends. This higher faculty is that of <strong>Reason </strong>and is, to a degree, unique to humans. As individual humans are different in their biology, cultures, and dispositions, how do we abstract humanity to a homogeneous whole? Well, Reason. When properly applied, logical reasoning should deduce fixed conclusions from a set of premises.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>The Faculty of Reason, in other words, is universal in all Rational Beings.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reason</strong> stands above <strong>I</strong><strong>nstinct</strong> since it can validate instinctual actions but not vice versa. The faculty of reason is what separates us from the animal, for instinctual actions occur in both. Just as Science is not necessary for humans to live but can indeed be used as a faculty to make life convenient and better, Reason, similarly, is a powerful faculty for us to make civilization possible.</p>\n<p>So to start, we have <strong>Free Will </strong>as an axiom and <strong>Reason </strong>as the optimum faculty to take actions, we can proceed towards an <strong>Ethical Theory.</strong> A theory starts with definitions, and the first and foremost definition we require is that of a  <strong>Good Action</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> Kant defines <em><strong>Good</strong> as <strong>Goodness-in-itself</strong></em>. (Ha! but let me explain)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Though there can be possibly many virtues(intelligence, patience etc.,), they lose their essence when used as means towards some goal. Say donation of wealth to save taxes or raise one&#8217;s position in society. The <strong>Good Will</strong> is the only source of moral value. But we still haven&#8217;t defined the <strong>Good Will</strong>, and shall proceed towards that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Many consider stoic living or frugality to be a virtue, but is it though? Moderation or detachment can be attributes of evil(Michael Corleone comes to mind)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>DUTY AS THE &#8220;GOOD&#8221; WILL</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Human Will exercises judgment through three methods: &#8211; <strong>Self Interest, Inclinations, and Duty.</strong> Those who have studied economics can understand it in terms of the utility approach(<em>Kantian ethics are opposed to Utilitarianism- I use it just for easier exposition</em>)</p>\n<p>Suppose we take a <strong>good action</strong> – say philanthropy is <strong>good</strong>. For some, what matters is that the deed was done, but not so for Kant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>If an act of charity is done in expectation of recognition or to save taxes, then it is an action borne out of <strong>self-interest</strong>. For Kant, this doesn’t entail moral worth since the person doing the action is deriving value directly out of it.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Suppose that the philanthropic action is done not from <strong>self-interest, </strong>but simply because it makes one happy. For Kant, even such actions don’t entail objective moral worth, since it is done out of an individual&#8217;s <strong>inclinations or preferences</strong>. An example would drive the argument better:-</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let there be two persons A and B where B derives happiness from donating food, while A does not. Suppose A and B then both perform the philanthropic deed. For the utilitarian, there’s no difference in the actions of A and B, but for Kant, the action was easier for B since he derives happiness from it, the total value of the deed goes to his utility function, and the rest as say moral value. For A instead, who doesn’t derive any happiness from the deed, the value from action doesn&#8217;t exist as individual utility, but solely as moral value. Thus A has done something more moral than B in performing the same action.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Hence, Duty is the sole generator of moral value, for if done by actions of preference or self-interest would not be objective, as preferences vary among people, and then the only outcome to generate objective moral value is not to see the actions as a means to happiness, but rather the action itself, even if it provides discomfort, so that one need not even consider utility concerns when taking certain actions.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Here, two clarifications are required:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>There might be objections that since Kant started with  Free Will, then isn&#8217;t a <strong>binding duty</strong> self-contradictory?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kant answers that though the will must indeed submit to duty, the will does so <em>willingly </em>i.e. out of respect since the rational will acknowledges that such duty transcends the will so that any rational person can determine the sanctity of a duty through the application of transparent reason.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>What if the laws and duties represent the self-interest of the legislator?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The answer to this question is the focus of the next section and introduction of the crux of Kant&#8217;s system &#8211; <strong>The Categorical Imperative.</strong></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">THE LEGISLATION OF LAWS/DUTIES</span></h3>\n<p>It would be prudent to start with a definition.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>A <strong>M</strong><strong>axim</strong> is any principle an individual might consider to be <strong>good</strong>. Once a maxim passes <strong>Kant’s criterion of legislation</strong> it can hence be enacted as a <strong>L</strong><strong>aw.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Take any maxim, say a person believing that <strong>white lies</strong> to be <strong>good</strong>. Can such a maxim be objectively good? Surely not. A way to test it is through the <em><strong>Principle of Universality(Kant&#8217;s criterion) &#8211; </strong></em></p>\n<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s suppose that the maxim of <strong>white lies </strong>is a universal law to which every person is subject. Is it <strong>good? </strong>It would then imply that even the government could lie to its people whose duty then is to &#8220;protect people&#8221; by lying about policy enactments. But this is a logical contradiction since the only cause to lie would be <strong>as a means</strong> to protect its own interests rather than as <strong>a good-in-itself.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It is hence stated as thus:-</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Any individual maxim which is <strong>not</strong> a universally applicable as a <strong>law</strong> must contradict itself . </em></p></blockquote>\n<p>When is a maxim then applicable as a law? For Kant, only when it is <strong>categorical.</strong></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE and THE KINGDOM OF ENDS</strong></span></h4>\n<p>An imperative or a command can either be <strong>Hypothetical(Conditional) </strong>or <strong>Categorical(Unconditional). </strong></p>\n<p>So if the command is – <em><strong>You shall not lie</strong></em>, it is non-contingent, and a universal principle, but however if the command is &#8211; <em><strong>You shall not lie for lest it destroy your credibility</strong></em>, the maxim is then conditional. The difference between both is that while the first holds <strong>value in itself</strong>, that is not lying, the second derives <strong>value as a means to something</strong>, that is, credibility. So even if the action is the same, that is not lying, the moral worth of the first is clearly more than the second, and while the first principle is applicable universally and hence objective, the second applies to the subject in question.</p>\n<p>Law within a society could arise from divine, sovereign, or through modern democratic sources. The legislator can issue commands for his own self-interest, but if the law is categorical and not hypothetical, two things prevent such a happening.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The legislator himself then must be the object of the law, which prevents him from creating exigencies through which he could create exceptions possible only in the Hypothetical imperative.</li>\n<li>Self-interest can still manifest itself in categorical imperative when universal commands still serve the interests of the legislators. However, the only solution to such a problem is Kant&#8217;s final solution, stated as follows:-</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p> <em><strong>The Universal Law(The Categorical Imperative) can only be realized when Man is viewed as an end-in-himself.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>What does Kant mean when he says that every rational human is an end in itself? He means that any law which aims at maximization of social welfare cannot use humans as means towards such a goal, because human welfare is exactly the goal of such a law. A ruler using slavery as a means to achieve economic progress contradicts this principle even if the country benefits through rapid development and might increase overall social utility. This is better illustrated in the following example:-</p>\n<p>When humans are ends-in-themselves, a person’s utility should come from the increase in utility of the other in the same proportion. That is:-</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>U(A/[AB]) = U(A/[AA]) = U(B/[BA]) = U(B/[BB]) {Here &#8220;/&#8221; signifies given or &#8220;if&#8221; &#8211; interpreted as utility to A from an action of A to B should be equal to utility to A when he does an action for himself &#8211; Note that this is only applicable for &#8220;Duties&#8221; or &#8220;Laws&#8221; and not all actions or moral principles &#8211; Moral Laws can be imagined as Fundamental Rights as maxims.) </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Since the increase(decrease) in A’s utility from an action means the increase(decrease) in B’s utility from the same action, this satisfies Kan’ts criterion as a universal law of nature which is the categorical imperative.</strong> Now when we remove utility from this system such that it is a law bound by duty, which the rational will can ascertain, we are left with pure moral worth maximization. (of course inclinations, in reality, do differ, but when everything is determined by law, inclinations don’t really matter, as they introduce subjectivity into an objective system). The above final proof may seem convoluted but it has remarkably intuitive implications. This sums up Kant&#8217;s entire moral theory.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>At the most basic level, as pure humans, all humans hold the same intrinsic value, regardless of social status or skills, which can add market value or fancy value over and above the absolute intrinsic value.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>All rational beings are equal by law. This includes the legislator of laws who must be equally subject to the laws for the system to be consistent.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">IS ETHICS REAL OR A CONSTRUCT OF OUR BRAINS?</span></h3>\n<p>If you remember from the first section, we started with <strong>Free Will</strong> as the only axiom. That is the entire theory is contingent on that axiom through which Kant proceeded with his ethical system. Now Kant prepares us for the <em>Grand Finale</em>.</p>\n<p>Kant now shows that if this axiom is a <strong>truth</strong>, the whole system would become real and independent purely constituted from <strong>Reason</strong>. <strong>Free Will</strong> is tautological with the <strong>autonomy of the will. </strong>Kant argues that <strong>Free Will cannot be an assumption which we start with</strong> since it’s a necessary truth. In ignoring the affectations of senses in forming our morality and starting the system from reason itself is an act of free will, through which we uncover the concept of freedom as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>The will doesn’t define freedom but exercises it.

With regards to the content of\nthe previous post, I am glad to reveal that my Ph.D. proposal was modified to be\nmore grounded in mainstream economic theory, but retained the spirit of the\nexercise and hence left my faculty, my advisory committee and myself, better\noff. I have since submerged in getting back to intensive reading everything that\nwas not related to my research but finally composed myself to start on my\nthesis, to be presented in three years from today ideally.\n\nI, however, am glad though the absence from the blogosphere made me guilty, I am\nback with perhaps the most ambitious post to date, for I have lost my\nphilosophical virginity to Immanuel Kant, the greatest and one of the most\ndifficult philosophers to have existed, and have finished two-thirds of his\nwritings and have made copious notes, and fairly confident of having understood\nhis works somewhat. The present post outlines Kant’s ethical theory, from his\ncelebrated ‘Groundwork for Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals‘(yeah try\nsaying that 5 times!)\n\nIt is important to note that this is a purely theoretical exercise, and even if\nyou agree with the system or not, take it as a piece of art at the least, and\nsomething to think about at the most. I have tried to be lucid and precise,\nhowever, I yet lack the skills to interpret his work well enough to explain like\nyou’re five, and it is going to be a somewhat long post, but I request you to\nsave it or bookmark it, and really stick with it because a) I have spent a lot\nof time in extracting Kant’s thought from a very dense book. b) It would be\nworthwhile at least as an entry to perhaps without question one of the greatest\nthinkers to have ever lived. And now, we shall start in our endeavor.\n\nDisclaimer – Please don’t focus on the use of pronouns as I’ve used man as the\nmode of analysis, out of convenience since I have a penis and think like a male.\n\nOf Good, Evil and all that Jazz- A Case for Objective Morality by Immanuel Kant\nThere is a fine distinction between Natural Science and Social Science, for, in\nthe world of natural science, we use our senses to interpret external objects,\nthat is, while we can be sure that there is a tree in front of us, we are\nlimited by the resolution of our eyes to interpret what our brain shows us of\nthe tree. An animal with far stronger eyesight might see a shade of colors\nunfathomable to us, thereby seeing a truer picture of the reality, but we can’t\nbe sure that anything can grasp the true nature of any object, say, except for a\nperfect omniscient being, let us call it God.\n\nSocial Science, however, is different. Let’s start with the basis of all social\nscience – Ethics. Why? Well, it is the foundation on which the premise of a\ncivilization rests. The acknowledgment of principles of right and wrong is the\nsource of Law and Justice. Politics and Economics derive from the interpretation\nof right, wrong; pleasure and pain which we derive from? Well – Ethics. It is\nbad to hurt another person can be within one’s conscience, but as a law means\ndoing so would incur punishment formally. Ethics can these days be seen in a\nmore metaphysical light thanks to anticipated developments in the not so distant\nfuture.\n\n> Suppose you design artificial intelligence and have to program an ethical system\nfor the machine to follow. Would you want it to statistically emulate humans? I\nhope not. Humans would go extinct in a year. How to then program ethics into an\nintelligent machine, such that within the scope of a free will, the machines\nstill make choices under the logical system supplanted by us, and which would\nnot get us annihilated?\n\n\nEthics is a construction of human thought(or is it?) Unlike objects which can\nnever be known in their true form because we are limited by sense, we can create\nan imagined world which has every property carefully laid out by us. To do so,\nwe need to create a theory that is independent of all actual experience(No\nempirical observations, say when designing that machine.) Can we do that? How do\nwe do that? Kant did that. And he did it pretty well. But the result is\nsomething that we would probably be underwhelmed with. The generality of theory\nto make it independent from all facets of how humans actually live makes it\nsomewhat restrictive. But it’s not the result but the accomplishment of the\nconstruction of such a system that is important here. And so we start-\n\nTHE RECIPE OF OBJECTIVE MORALITY\nWe start with the first axiom – Agency orFree Will(Remember this because it’s\nimportant in the last section)\n\nHumans can make choices and can deliberately choose to not choose something just\nbecause well, they can. Nature has granted humans with two devices to take\nactions – Instinct and Reason. Instinct acts on two principles – Pleasure and\nPain.

The Murder of God they intend!’;\n\n‘Burn this holy ground with their skins would they!’\n\n‘Teach them burning I shall for eternity!’\n\n\n\nThe song now in its final stages stretched,\n\nHesitancy, struggle, but no stoppage yet;\n\nThe struggle made the beauty sublime,\n\nA beautiful song of the dead;\n\n\n\nAs the breath and heart lose their timber,\n\nAs tapered the final stretch;\n\nSlower and slower and slower still,\n\nWhen God found out the game thus planned;\n\n\n\nDoes God have Free Will? We ask,\n\n‘Then why is the world the way it is?’\n\nDo the choices he maketh the world better,\n\nHow possible if the world starts in perfect?\n\n\n\nThe answer now we know as did they,\n\nThey, who forced God to play his hand;\n\nMan’s Will overpowered him, and joined the song did he,\n\nOf the folly of his actions, for his own children did not know he.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod can never lose, this fact is absolute.\n\nBut in winning this game he lost to Mankind\n\nAs they slowly fell to victory, and as the song petered out at last,\n\nCollapsed they did, enveloped by whiteness;\n\nFade to White.\n\n\n\nPostScript\n\n\nIn heaven find their children and play, in fields of pearly heavenly white,\n\nYet God came and smiled as they smiled, below an empty church stood still;\n\nNo one to pray and no one to sing, such an emptiness was this,\n\nBut God is true emptiness and emptiness is God, is the sage wisdom, and with\nthis,\n\nGod committed suicide and played with his children.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199747e","created_at":"2018-09-24T20:35:53.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T20:35:53.000Z","published_at":"2018-09-24T20:35:53.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ef993fa5c47140001997492","uuid":"4edc37fb-4e4a-42f8-b947-734cb599d5d2","title":"How to make a damn near perfect cup of coffee","slug":"temp-slug-18","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>I love coffee.

The Excerpt is taken from the\nessay – ‘Of Reading and Writing’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf all writings, I love only that written in Blood.\n\nOne can’t comprehend blood which is unfamiliar, you, the idle reader. \n\nFor to know the reader you write for, stinks thy spirit. That in the long run,\neveryone will learn to read shall ruin writing, nay, but thinking.\n\nI don’t write to be read, I write to be felt. For what I give in blood, shall be\nunderstood in blood.\n\nIn the Mountains, the shortest route is between peaks, but then, you must have\nlong legs.\n\nThe mountain air is cold and thin, danger lurks each moment, yet courage laughs.\n\nThe clouds are black under me, and hence I laugh.\n\nFor only those who can laugh can climb the highest. Laugh at what’s real, and\nwhat’s not.\n\nAnd the warrior shall reach the top, for wisdom is a woman, favors the best of\nmen.\n\n“Life is hard to bear” – But if it weren’t, would pride exist? Could one enjoy\nsleep?\n\n“Life is hard to bear” – Says the tender finery in Sheep, tis finer to be the\nnoble ass.\n\nAre we rosebuds? which drop from drops of dew?\n\nDo we love life, because we love living? Or because we love loving?\n\nLove is madness, and there’s a method in madness.\n\nLife is not a song of butterflies and soap-bubbles for which it’s loved.\n\nThere exists a devil, much like your God- Serious, solemn and profound. It is\nGravity.\n\nAnd my god is your devil, for my god knows how to laugh, and how to dance.\n\nFor one does not kill the devil from anger, but with laughter- Come, warrior,\nSlay the devil with me!\n\nI learned to walk, now I run. Come, let’s learn to fly.\n\nOnly when I fly could I see myself under myself, and a god dancing within me.\n\n\n\nThus Spake Zarathustra","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199747e","created_at":"2019-06-24T14:06:49.000Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T14:06:49.000Z","published_at":"2019-06-24T14:06:49.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ef993fa5c47140001997494","uuid":"d29a0aaf-22e2-4dc2-bf5b-b0eb17355e7c","title":"Dreams","slug":"dreams","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is with me when there are days I can&#8217;t think of a single word to communicate, to days like today, when I churn out a poem in minutes!

These flowers shine so radiantly, How come we’ve never looked at them?”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>And that I feel, is the problem. We have gone too far, where pausing for a moment, taking a step back, and spending an entire afternoon at the park causes feelings of restlessness in just picturing it. There is so much to do. Yet, ironically, Exactly the picture of watching a flower, and I mean really watching it, like a blind person watching colour for the first time ever, is what all the poets, mystics, and even us, romanticise of, the only consolation we provide &#8211; *<i>Someday, certainly not now, there are bills to be paid*.</i></p>\\n<p>We have replaced **<b>Reality</b>** with **<b>concepts</b>**, which is faster, efficient, but sacrificial. A tree out there in its naked existence is not a fact of experience with its stimuli, but rather the word, the common noun, the mental picture &#8211; “a tree”. This fact, of replacing the child-like perception of trees for concepts of trees, I assert, is the fundamental basis for the inevitable existential crisis in each of our lives. Why inevitable? Because of the one fact &#8211; I, and you, and everyone you know, on one day, will die.</p>\\n<p>This fact of our inevitable mortality, is perhaps the fundamental core of our lives. An empty word, *<b>death</b>* perhaps in one’s youth, of course we are not dying now, and we just take it as fact, like we just take the fact of our existence, like poverty, exists, and we might be subject to, but in some other reality perhaps, and hence escape the question. But that one day comes, if not dead by accident, that we have to go through the painful process of looking our own mortality in its actual impending reality, perhaps being diagnosed with terminal illness, or during old age, we have to make our peace with it.</p>\\n<p>But before any peace is made, yet grappling with the full reality of it, is pure anxiety. Just ask this question, “<i>what have I really done till now?”</i> And we are on track towards it, yet this approach will never lead to a forceful peace even, content peace is not even a question, for then one must engage with this reality throughout their lives, to keep it in their heart, everyday, like a splinter attached to one’s body leaving one in constant pain, far worse than forgetting oneself in life, which in contrast seems idyllic, and would be so too, if not for the fact that we need be aware the party is about to end. I like this analogy a lot. So the rest of the essay takes from this analogy.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>&gt; There is a Party, and we find ourselves in the Party among many others. The Party will end by morning. All of us know that the Party will end, yet some would realise that just some minutes before it actually ends, while others would always have a look on their watch to see how much time is left. In a Party, we party. Now when we party authentically, we lose the sense of time altogether, and we know that too. How does the Party follow for the various party-goers?</p></blockquote>\\n<p>The time is finite. You can do a lot in this Party, but if you just keep thinking of how you can party best and remain indecisive, you have had a miserable Party, and want to extend it. Some of us do party, but it’s not an authentic party, for every moment of partying is accompanied by the awareness it will end, and so you try to do everything you can, and have a miserable party. Now let me discuss two more cases. What about that person, who doesn’t care about the time, says “<i>fuck that</i>”, and loses oneself in the party completely. For many, it is the ideal. The best party ever, you have never partied like this before, until the announcement is made, 20 minutes to wrap up. You feel this high, and now don’t want the party to stop, although for different reasons from the first one. Yet you lost all track of time while partying, and now have to come to terms with it. More so, this was your last Party before exams. However, you were so busy enjoying the Party, that you didn’t take time to think “<i>Wow! I’m partying like crazy, and this Party is awesome”</i> when it was at its peak.</p>\\n<p>There is no escaping the party anxiety because, as self-conscious beings, there is an inescapable need for us to weave experiences of life into a narrative or a story, although its false continuity stems from discrete important events chained together into a coherent story of your life. Without this model of reality, how can we fit experiences? We can live in naked experience, and it is the best if we can, with the caveat then if we don’t delay the inevitable of suddenly waking up from the dream, to know that now it’s time to go to school. But if we did think “<i>wow, this Party is so good</i>” then you have already escaped from authentic experience where the Party and to party have become concepts which has negated at least some part of the actual Reality of the Party and your partying a few moments back. And the tragedy all too real is this &#8211; Once you have had thought this thought, you have to now party at this level for the rest of this Party, never fully involved, with some aspect of time always there, infected you like a virus so that in no way can you expect to party like the way you did for the remainder. And then it goes downhill.</p>\\n<p>As partying beings, who once partied in full authenticity that we were THE PARTY itself, and were by default lost, this rude sudden jolt is the first initiation for many of us into this phenomenon of anxiety, mostly in our early adulthood. We see others partying, some like us who sooner or later had this jolt, suddenly started noticing the Party and the partying people, and asking questions for the first time &#8211; as if a new lens had be placed on your head when everything familiar suddenly was not, and the later you woke up, the ruder the jolt. I like to think of it this way &#8211;</p>\\n<blockquote><p>&gt; You live in your room and don’t pay much attention to it when living there for years. The fan, the cupboards, the floor &#8211; all just a fuzzy background. But one day, you find your room completely reorganised, the bed’s orientation reversed, the cupboard shifted, and a new fan. Or perhaps when you visit your bedroom after months of living in the hostel, the first few moments of how alien this all too familiar room, that feeling is the first foray of the rude awakening.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This brings me to that final way of partying, which although the second-best, yet the only practical option for a Party which inevitably ends.(the authentic losing-one-self in the infinite Party being the theoretical best)</p>\\n<p>This is after that jolt, which is a necessary medicine, to realise the nature of the Party is essentially what the Buddha taught through his Four-Noble-Truths and his Eightfold Path. Where now it’s time to apply the Eightfold path. How to minimise the pain now that you know that you can never party the same way again? Historically, many antidotes have been given- broadly under two schools of thought.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>To reject partying, and the Party altogether, so as it doesn’t even matter when it ends.</li>\\n<li>To party as hard as possible, with the maxim “<i>Fake it till you Make it”</i>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The Eastern Party Association would tell you this &#8211;</p>\\n<blockquote><p>&gt; Why are you bothered? You are not a party-man. This Party will end, but there will be many other Parties, even if you don’t remember this one because you got so drunk. Also, all this Party is an illusion, the Real World is WHERE the Party is taking place( even though you have never seen anything outside the Party) , because this Party is YOUR notion of Everything. After the Party ends, you will for the first time see how Insignificant the Party is, for There is something known as the World and that’s the biggest Party. In fact the better you do there, the grander and elite would the Parties you’ll land up in. How do I know this? because If there is a Party, there is something as not-a-Party(since Party ends), and where both Party and non Party happen should be in one place? No? So just see yourself not as the party-goer, not even this Party, but the biggest Party of it all, And sonnyboy, you ARE that Party, It is in you, through you, outside you. It is all there is.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>And this new jolt of awareness? And that it will end? and that you can’t lose yourself?</p>\\n<blockquote><p>&gt; Why are you taking it as a splinter full of pain? Haven’t you seen that unlike others, you have seen and questioned yourself partying? Now you know what is a genuine fact. This Party will end. And why does one NEED to party in the Party? If you’re in the Party, you are partying, as much as anyone else. Now that you have questioned and sought me, and we are having this conversation, isn’t this Party more than mere dancing and singing? Don’t you feel lighter, of a burden you had always carried but couldn’t give a name? Haven’t you lost yourself in this conversation? Aren’t you looking at this Party with a deeper appreciation for what you took for granted? Unlike that fellow who’s looking at his watch, doing nothing but wanting to party, aren’t you at peace, for now you know you are partying, and that to party is to not only dance, but the fact that you are here, in this Party. This moment, is all you need, all such moments then are enough, there is no chain. The end of the Party is the default mode of Life, you just don’t know that, this is but a mere moment, You don’t remember because you were piss drunk at the last Party and blacked out. And suddenly you woke up thrown into this Party, but now that you are in peace, you don’t need to get piss-drunk anymore, you’re free. So come, lets drink some beer and play Darts, I’ll beat you.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Does all anxiety inevitably lead to that one fundamental anxiety, the <em>sine qua non</em> underlying all but never disclosing itself?

Yet, ironically, Exactly the picture of watching a flower, and I mean really watching it, like a blind person watching colour for the first time ever, is what all the poets, mystics, and even us, romanticise of, the only consolation we provide &#8211; *<i>Someday, certainly not now, there are bills to be paid*.</i></p>\n<p>We have replaced **<b>Reality</b>** with **<b>concepts</b>**, which is faster, efficient, but sacrificial. A tree out there in its naked existence is not a fact of experience with its stimuli, but rather the word, the common noun, the mental picture &#8211; “a tree”. This fact, of replacing the child-like perception of trees for concepts of trees, I assert, is the fundamental basis for the inevitable existential crisis in each of our lives. Why inevitable? Because of the one fact &#8211; I, and you, and everyone you know, on one day, will die.</p>\n<p>This fact of our inevitable mortality, is perhaps the fundamental core of our lives. An empty word, *<b>death</b>* perhaps in one’s youth, of course we are not dying now, and we just take it as fact, like we just take the fact of our existence, like poverty, exists, and we might be subject to, but in some other reality perhaps, and hence escape the question. But that one day comes, if not dead by accident, that we have to go through the painful process of looking our own mortality in its actual impending reality, perhaps being diagnosed with terminal illness, or during old age, we have to make our peace with it.</p>\n<p>But before any peace is made, yet grappling with the full reality of it, is pure anxiety. Just ask this question, “<i>what have I really done till now?”</i> And we are on track towards it, yet this approach will never lead to a forceful peace even, content peace is not even a question, for then one must engage with this reality throughout their lives, to keep it in their heart, everyday, like a splinter attached to one’s body leaving one in constant pain, far worse than forgetting oneself in life, which in contrast seems idyllic, and would be so too, if not for the fact that we need be aware the party is about to end. I like this analogy a lot. So the rest of the essay takes from this analogy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&gt; There is a Party, and we find ourselves in the Party among many others. The Party will end by morning. All of us know that the Party will end, yet some would realise that just some minutes before it actually ends, while others would always have a look on their watch to see how much time is left. In a Party, we party. Now when we party authentically, we lose the sense of time altogether, and we know that too. How does the Party follow for the various party-goers?</p></blockquote>\n<p>The time is finite. You can do a lot in this Party, but if you just keep thinking of how you can party best and remain indecisive, you have had a miserable Party, and want to extend it. Some of us do party, but it’s not an authentic party, for every moment of partying is accompanied by the awareness it will end, and so you try to do everything you can, and have a miserable party. Now let me discuss two more cases. What about that person, who doesn’t care about the time, says “<i>fuck that</i>”, and loses oneself in the party completely. For many, it is the ideal. The best party ever, you have never partied like this before, until the announcement is made, 20 minutes to wrap up. You feel this high, and now don’t want the party to stop, although for different reasons from the first one. Yet you lost all track of time while partying, and now have to come to terms with it. More so, this was your last Party before exams. However, you were so busy enjoying the Party, that you didn’t take time to think “<i>Wow! I’m partying like crazy, and this Party is awesome”</i> when it was at its peak.</p>\n<p>There is no escaping the party anxiety because, as self-conscious beings, there is an inescapable need for us to weave experiences of life into a narrative or a story, although its false continuity stems from discrete important events chained together into a coherent story of your life. Without this model of reality, how can we fit experiences? We can live in naked experience, and it is the best if we can, with the caveat then if we don’t delay the inevitable of suddenly waking up from the dream, to know that now it’s time to go to school. But if we did think “<i>wow, this Party is so good</i>” then you have already escaped from authentic experience where the Party and to party have become concepts which has negated at least some part of the actual Reality of the Party and your partying a few moments back. And the tragedy all too real is this &#8211; Once you have had thought this thought, you have to now party at this level for the rest of this Party, never fully involved, with some aspect of time always there, infected you like a virus so that in no way can you expect to party like the way you did for the remainder. And then it goes downhill.</p>\n<p>As partying beings, who once partied in full authenticity that we were THE PARTY itself, and were by default lost, this rude sudden jolt is the first initiation for many of us into this phenomenon of anxiety, mostly in our early adulthood. We see others partying, some like us who sooner or later had this jolt, suddenly started noticing the Party and the partying people, and asking questions for the first time &#8211; as if a new lens had be placed on your head when everything familiar suddenly was not, and the later you woke up, the ruder the jolt. I like to think of it this way &#8211;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&gt; You live in your room and don’t pay much attention to it when living there for years. The fan, the cupboards, the floor &#8211; all just a fuzzy background. But one day, you find your room completely reorganised, the bed’s orientation reversed, the cupboard shifted, and a new fan. Or perhaps when you visit your bedroom after months of living in the hostel, the first few moments of how alien this all too familiar room, that feeling is the first foray of the rude awakening.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This brings me to that final way of partying, which although the second-best, yet the only practical option for a Party which inevitably ends.(the authentic losing-one-self in the infinite Party being the theoretical best)</p>\n<p>This is after that jolt, which is a necessary medicine, to realise the nature of the Party is essentially what the Buddha taught through his Four-Noble-Truths and his Eightfold Path.

You are not a party-man. This Party will end, but there will be many other Parties, even if you don’t remember this one because you got so drunk. Also, all this Party is an illusion, the Real World is WHERE the Party is taking place( even though you have never seen anything outside the Party) , because this Party is YOUR notion of Everything. After the Party ends, you will for the first time see how Insignificant the Party is, for There is something known as the World and that’s the biggest Party. In fact the better you do there, the grander and elite would the Parties you’ll land up in. How do I know this? because If there is a Party, there is something as not-a-Party(since Party ends), and where both Party and non Party happen should be in one place? No? So just see yourself not as the party-goer, not even this Party, but the biggest Party of it all, And sonnyboy, you ARE that Party, It is in you, through you, outside you.

And that it will end? and that you can’t lose yourself?</p>\n<blockquote><p>&gt; Why are you taking it as a splinter full of pain? Haven’t you seen that unlike others, you have seen and questioned yourself partying? Now you know what is a genuine fact. This Party will end. And why does one NEED to party in the Party? If you’re in the Party, you are partying, as much as anyone else. Now that you have questioned and sought me, and we are having this conversation, isn’t this Party more than mere dancing and singing? Don’t you feel lighter, of a burden you had always carried but couldn’t give a name? Haven’t you lost yourself in this conversation? Aren’t you looking at this Party with a deeper appreciation for what you took for granted? Unlike that fellow who’s looking at his watch, doing nothing but wanting to party, aren’t you at peace, for now you know you are partying, and that to party is to not only dance, but the fact that you are here, in this Party. This moment, is all you need, all such moments then are enough, there is no chain. The end of the Party is the default mode of Life, you just don’t know that, this is but a mere moment, You don’t remember because you were piss drunk at the last Party and blacked out. And suddenly you woke up thrown into this Party, but now that you are in peace, you don’t need to get piss-drunk anymore, you’re free.

They can be either feelings of transcendence which cannot be specified into any category, or of distinct colours which we intertwine events with. Perhaps no example is as fundamental as the seasons most of us encounter every year.</p>\\n<pre> Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter</pre>\\n<p>Universally Spring is associated with life, growth, happiness, virility. Summer associated with ripening and peakedness, a maturity, with activity. Autumn is the contrary of spring, associated with preparation of winter, a decay, the waning of life, and finally, winter is associated with harshness, death and anti-life, the contrary of summer.</p>\\n<p>But we are too much of reductionists, for there is more than meets the eye. We somehow want to believe that Nature behaves with some kind of human exceptionalism, but that is what we attribute to it, and not it to us.</p>\\n<p>Imagine a lush garden with booming flowers, the archetypal image of spring. Within the lush green grass, Nature goes on as usual, perhaps laughing at our childish desire for it to succumb to our imagery. There is one maxim with which Nature works, and it is this</p>\\n<pre>Life feeds on itself.</pre>\\n<p>And for spring to be possible, a transaction must be made, and on magnification, the leaves have all sorts of muck, with flytraps catching up on insects, and ants decomposing dead caracasses.</p>\\n<p>Only when survival is not at hand does Nature seem beautiful and motherly, in more primal times, Nature was the all mighty God, and not a loving one at that. It needed to be made happy so as to bless us with rains, provide us seasons without plagues, pests or locusts, and more often that not, it demanded a sacrifice of us. And that is what was Nature as such, not an aesthetic beauty or an abstract concept, but the sheer Reality-Sublime because our fates were wholly dependent upon its moods. It thus shaped our character, for the character in this primal stage can be shaped by only one fact &#8211; <strong>Survival</strong></p>\\n<h2>The Paradox of the Innocent Violent Primitive Man, and the Cunning Cultured Modern Person : Spring in Autumn, Autumn in Spring.</h2>\\n<h3>Stage I &#8211; The Dawn</h3>\\n<p>As much as we can make cartoons of the primitive man, of a Fred Flinstone, with their cartoonish ape like behavior, Encountering a stranger human of those times would probably get you killed instantly, no questions asked. But this kind of evil is not what we associate with the kinds we are now accustomed to, of the Hitlers and Stalins of the world, but an innocence in this evil, just like a predator is not evil when it hunts or scavenges its prey, and is as innocent as all are in nature, this violence in the primal man rather stems from confusion and fear.</p>\\n<p>Superstitions can cause evil and violence with the best of intentions, and any modern ethical civilization would necessarily have roots in acts of barbarism which are not from cunning, but only natural. This spring corresponds to then the beginning of human civilization, barbarous from our lens, but in reality the most innocent of all stages, closest to our animal brethren, guided by ritual sacrifices as offerings to God.</p>\\n<h3>Stage II: The Noon</h3>\\n<p>The next stage of human civilization again represents a new kind of spring, a more mature one. Though the evolution of culture via agriculture and rise of towns reduce this primordial dependance on mother earth, in this nascent stage, we are still as helpless to the vagaries of nature. The essence of that primal man though doesn&#8217;t go away, the rituals and witches of the earlier times are simply replaced by priests and organized violence via warfare. Even the scale of victims from violence then increases with a certain indifference towards the reality of it. Violence in warfare is now abstracted into concepts of glory, and innocence is maintained under the veneer of civilization.</p>\\n<h3>Stage III: Dusk</h3>\\n<p>The next stage of human spring is of maturation of culture and industry. In fact, in this pre-pubescant industry, war leads the economy, the growth to which we have attributed to this age is a <em>spring of suffering</em>. We tend to casually ignore the fact that economic growth and development historically has been stimulated through warfare, even in our current age that being the case, yet we ignore the fact to not confront the reality of human decadence, for we are now much more moral than the primitive and medieval people surely, as the zeitgeist would like you to believe.</p>\\n<p>The spring of the age of mass warfare, peace is established with blood. The workers now have overlords, and spring becomes a tradition to celebrate, not a blossoming of the fruits of nature, rather the idea of it,  enjoyed now as a festival in urban centres, divorced of the earlier, rural modes of life. Wars are now normalised and a fact of indifference, which leads to a detached ignorance towards grossly significant acts like mass-murder, now at most being a cause for a shock and awe, of course if it is heinous enough to catch our attention spans. The collective consciousness is now twisted enough, that the destruction of warfare is abstracted and glorified. The connection with the primal man is now severed, the age of innocence is gone, but spring remains, in an artificial construct of civilization.</p>\\n<p>Still, there was a reason to be upbeat with the onset of spring, despite the corruptions, the stage though goes lower, when this corruption makes the man realize some of it, and is not upbeat anymore. This is the start of spring in the modern era, an <strong>age of nihilism</strong>.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Stage IV: The Night</strong></h3>\\n<p>The government is now our overlords, ruling via direct oppression and collection of taxes which only goes into funding wars we don’t need. The farmers, artisans in the countryside are still in touch with the primal man, and hence there are still remnants of that primal innocence, but it is far away from the social consciousness of the times, as exhibited by the major centers of growth i.e. the cities. Still, even the farmers and artisans are not completely immune, for their innocence is now being replaced from joy to one of a prideful glory,  via the medium of money. For money increases power, and power is glory. War in this age is almost farcicial now, a mockery of what it once was, though as much as real, with a scale of destruction hitherto unimagined. It&#8217;s farcicial because there is no objective which legitimizes it, but abstract ideas which are of no relevance to anyone. The threshold of indifference is so high, that only crimes against the core human principles, of the scale of the holocaust or nuclear weapons invoke the same reactions it did earlier when villages were burnt or massacred, still for some the latter is more barbaric than the former. We are by now, at this stage, tired of this. How much more corruption can there be? Life becomes faster, the economy larger, and it ultimately leads to a revolt, and inevitably to the age of revolution.</p>\\n<p>Now there&#8217;s peace, the overlords have been done away with, and after a brief revival of innocence of that earlier spring, there is an eerie lull. For this silence is unnatural, being  seized upon by force, result of which there is a new equilibrium. Revolution leads to further revolutions. The revolutionary of the day past are the present incumbents, who have to now deal with the incoming revolts within discreet circles underground, Now the enemies of the state and its people, in a cruel taste of circularity. This spring is ironic, no? There are mild eruptions, but nothing significant, the new overlords are well trained in this battle art. One could say the continual revolutions carry the primal innocence of destruction which has been our nature And that&#8217;s why no era can do away with these, the young embedded with the genes of disorder, how are they to blame? The only difference is that rituals are not the rationalizations, but is now called justice. There are now moderates and extremists in every such discreet groups, who differ on the level of acceptable blood during play, and always try to undermine each other, allowing the Stalins of the world to keep afloat.</p>\\n<h3>Stage V: The Twilight</h3>\\n<p>The next spring arrives, and with it some necessary optimism, but where lies the joy, and the beauty? The fields are now no longer dependent on nature, Science has mastered it, and won. There is plenty, and still, despite all conveniences of technology, one fact remains constant and will always do so, for we can’t push away the source of philosophical problems inherent in this struggle of Man vs Nature. Any scientific conveniences  of life cannot be filled with the void of that single fact, that Life indeed is, and always be, an endeavour of suffering, and all desires can only strengthen our bondage to it. All remedies, positive experiences would only fail, the new ethics, the abstract concepts, the straightening of nature curves is counter current, and we still wonder why are we still sad, despite our security, our culture?</p>\\n<p>The decay, does it stem from trading off human nature, the innocent primality for peace and long lives? and when we are devoid of innocence in the age of extreme civilization, is how we return to the roots after all, through an orgy of carnage when bereft of innocence. Killing now is no longer an extreme reaction of revenge, and there is no pity. There is a zeal in it, almost like an explosion of those repressed urges since the first spring, this is spring in full blossom, the blood waters the soil for the renewing of the cycle. Even murder reflects nihilism, the threshold is now at the atomic level, nothing short of nuclear disasters can unite people. In this dionysian bloodbath, the cycle is completed, and the first spring of the next cycle carries on like the beginning.

But this kind of evil is not what we associate with the kinds we are now accustomed to, of the Hitlers and Stalins of the world, but an innocence in this evil, just like a predator is not evil when it hunts or scavenges its prey, and is as innocent as all are in nature, this violence in the primal man rather stems from confusion and fear.</p>\n<p>Superstitions can cause evil and violence with the best of intentions, and any modern ethical civilization would necessarily have roots in acts of barbarism which are not from cunning, but only natural. This spring corresponds to then the beginning of human civilization, barbarous from our lens, but in reality the most innocent of all stages, closest to our animal brethren, guided by ritual sacrifices as offerings to God.</p>\n<h3>Stage II: The Noon</h3>\n<p>The next stage of human civilization again represents a new kind of spring, a more mature one. Though the evolution of culture via agriculture and rise of towns reduce this primordial dependance on mother earth, in this nascent stage, we are still as helpless to the vagaries of nature. The essence of that primal man though doesn&#8217;t go away, the rituals and witches of the earlier times are simply replaced by priests and organized violence via warfare. Even the scale of victims from violence then increases with a certain indifference towards the reality of it. Violence in warfare is now abstracted into concepts of glory, and innocence is maintained under the veneer of civilization.</p>\n<h3>Stage III: Dusk</h3>\n<p>The next stage of human spring is of maturation of culture and industry. In fact, in this pre-pubescant industry, war leads the economy, the growth to which we have attributed to this age is a <em>spring of suffering</em>. We tend to casually ignore the fact that economic growth and development historically has been stimulated through warfare, even in our current age that being the case, yet we ignore the fact to not confront the reality of human decadence, for we are now much more moral than the primitive and medieval people surely, as the zeitgeist would like you to believe.</p>\n<p>The spring of the age of mass warfare, peace is established with blood. The workers now have overlords, and spring becomes a tradition to celebrate, not a blossoming of the fruits of nature, rather the idea of it,  enjoyed now as a festival in urban centres, divorced of the earlier, rural modes of life. Wars are now normalised and a fact of indifference, which leads to a detached ignorance towards grossly significant acts like mass-murder, now at most being a cause for a shock and awe, of course if it is heinous enough to catch our attention spans. The collective consciousness is now twisted enough, that the destruction of warfare is abstracted and glorified. The connection with the primal man is now severed, the age of innocence is gone, but spring remains, in an artificial construct of civilization.</p>\n<p>Still, there was a reason to be upbeat with the onset of spring, despite the corruptions, the stage though goes lower, when this corruption makes the man realize some of it, and is not upbeat anymore. This is the start of spring in the modern era, an <strong>age of nihilism</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Stage IV: The Night</strong></h3>\n<p>The government is now our overlords, ruling via direct oppression and collection of taxes which only goes into funding wars we don’t need. The farmers, artisans in the countryside are still in touch with the primal man, and hence there are still remnants of that primal innocence, but it is far away from the social consciousness of the times, as exhibited by the major centers of growth i.e. the cities. Still, even the farmers and artisans are not completely immune, for their innocence is now being replaced from joy to one of a prideful glory,  via the medium of money. For money increases power, and power is glory. War in this age is almost farcicial now, a mockery of what it once was, though as much as real, with a scale of destruction hitherto unimagined. It&#8217;s farcicial because there is no objective which legitimizes it, but abstract ideas which are of no relevance to anyone. The threshold of indifference is so high, that only crimes against the core human principles, of the scale of the holocaust or nuclear weapons invoke the same reactions it did earlier when villages were burnt or massacred, still for some the latter is more barbaric than the former. We are by now, at this stage, tired of this. How much more corruption can there be? Life becomes faster, the economy larger, and it ultimately leads to a revolt, and inevitably to the age of revolution.</p>\n<p>Now there&#8217;s peace, the overlords have been done away with, and after a brief revival of innocence of that earlier spring, there is an eerie lull. For this silence is unnatural, being  seized upon by force, result of which there is a new equilibrium. Revolution leads to further revolutions. The revolutionary of the day past are the present incumbents, who have to now deal with the incoming revolts within discreet circles underground, Now the enemies of the state and its people, in a cruel taste of circularity. This spring is ironic, no? There are mild eruptions, but nothing significant, the new overlords are well trained in this battle art. One could say the continual revolutions carry the primal innocence of destruction which has been our nature And that&#8217;s why no era can do away with these, the young embedded with the genes of disorder, how are they to blame? The only difference is that rituals are not the rationalizations, but is now called justice. There are now moderates and extremists in every such discreet groups, who differ on the level of acceptable blood during play, and always try to undermine each other, allowing the Stalins of the world to keep afloat.</p>\n<h3>Stage V: The Twilight</h3>\n<p>The next spring arrives, and with it some necessary optimism, but where lies the joy, and the beauty? The fields are now no longer dependent on nature, Science has mastered it, and won. There is plenty, and still, despite all conveniences of technology, one fact remains constant and will always do so, for we can’t push away the source of philosophical problems inherent in this struggle of Man vs Nature. Any scientific conveniences  of life cannot be filled with the void of that single fact, that Life indeed is, and always be, an endeavour of suffering, and all desires can only strengthen our bondage to it. All remedies, positive experiences would only fail, the new ethics, the abstract concepts, the straightening of nature curves is counter current, and we still wonder why are we still sad, despite our security, our culture?</p>\n<p>The decay, does it stem from trading off human nature, the innocent primality for peace and long lives? and when we are devoid of innocence in the age of extreme civilization, is how we return to the roots after all, through an orgy of carnage when bereft of innocence. Killing now is no longer an extreme reaction of revenge, and there is no pity. There is a zeal in it, almost like an explosion of those repressed urges since the first spring, this is spring in full blossom, the blood waters the soil for the renewing of the cycle. Even murder reflects nihilism, the threshold is now at the atomic level, nothing short of nuclear disasters can unite people. In this dionysian bloodbath, the cycle is completed, and the first spring of the next cycle carries on like the beginning.

On foot, how long is it? And in the mind, how long? Not a second. What is time? Space we perceive with our organs, senses of sight and touch.Good. But where is the organ of time? How can we measure something about which we know nothing. We say that ‘Time passes’. Sure, let it pass. But how does one measure that? We believe time flows evenly, with scientific precision, but does it? As far as our consciousness is considered, it does not &#8211; We only assume it does, for the sake of convenience; and our units of measurement are purely arbitrary, sheer conventions…’</p></blockquote></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A much more nuanced take is taken up a few chapter later.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>§4 <em>Excursus on the Sense of Time</em>;<em>pp:100</em></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>There is after all , something peculiar about the process of habituating oneself in a new place, the often laborious fitting in and getting used to, which one undertakes for its own sake, and of set purpose to break it all off as soon as it is complete, or not long thereafter, and to return to one’s former state. </p><p>It is an interval, an interlude, inserted with the object of recreation, into the tenor of life’s main concerns; its purpose the relief of the organism, which is perpetually busy at its task of self-renewal, and which was in danger, almost in process, of being vitiated, slowed down, relaxed, by the bald, unjointed monotony of its daily course. </p><p>But what then is the cause of this relaxation, this slowing down that takes place when one does the same thing for too long at a time? It is not so much physical or mental fatigue or exhaustion, for if that were the case then complete rest would be the best restorative. It is rather something psychical; It means that the perception of time tends, through periods of unbroken uniformity, to fall away; the perception of time, so closely bound up with the consciousness of life that one may not be weakened without the other suffering a sensible impairment. </p><p>Many false conceptions are held concerning the nature of tedium. In general, it is thought that the interestingness and novelty of the time-content are what ‘make the time pass’; that is to say, shorten it; whereas monotony and emptiness check and restrain its flow. </p><p>This is only true with reservations. Vacuity, monotony, have, indeed the property of lingering out the moment and the hour and of making them tiresome. But they are capable of contracting and dissipating the larger, the very large time-units, to the point of reducing them to nothing at all. &gt; </p><p>And conversely, a full and interesting content can put wings to the hour and the day; yet it will lend to the general passage of time a weightiness, a breadth and solidity which cause the eventful years to flow far more slowly than those poor, bare, empty ones over which the wind passes and they are gone. Thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of time consequent upon monotony.</p><p>Great spaces of time passed in unbroken uniformity tend to shrink together in a way to make the heart stop beating for fear; when one day is like all the others, then they are all like one; complete uniformity would make the longest life seem short, and as though it had stolen away from us unawares. </p><p>Habituation is a falling asleep or fatiguing of the sense of time; which explains why young years pass slowly, while later life flings itself faster and faster upon its course. We are aware that the intercalation of periods of change and novelty is the only means by which we can refresh our sense of time, strengthen, retard, rejuvenate it, and therewith renew our perception of life itself. </p><p>Such is the purpose of our changes of air and scene, of all our sojourns at cures and bathing resorts; it is the secret of the healing power of change and incident.</p><blockquote><p>Our first days in a new place; time has a youthful, that is to say, a broad and a sweeping, flow, persisting for some six to eight days. Then, as one ‘gets used to the place’, a gradual shrinkage makes itself felt. He who clings or, better expressed, wishes to cling to life, will shudder to see how the days grow light and lighter, how they scurry by like dead leaves, until the last week, of some four, perhaps, is uncannily fugitive and fleet. </p><p>On the other hand, the quickening of the sense of time will flow out beyond the interval and reassert itself after the return to ordinary existence: the first days at home after the holiday will be lived with broader flow, freshly and youthfully &#8211; but only the first few, for one adjusts oneself more quickly to the rule than to the exception; and if the sense of time be already weakened by age, or &#8211; and this is a low sign of vitality &#8211; it was never really well developed, one drowses quickly back into the old life, and after four-and-twenty hours it is as though one had never been away, and the journey had been but a watch in the night.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<h1></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in the times of a pandemic is no longer a phase we have to simply wait over, rather, as we become accustomed to the circumstances prevailing, we’re now moving towards an <em>equilibrium</em> where such living becomes embedded in our psyche permanently, and consequently, becomes a permanent way of life.(Though surely, we are still in the infant stages of such a maturation and the future is ever uncertain.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these state of affairs, an experiment of nature on us one might conceive, we can approach this discontinuity as a tool for a more abstract unity, of what remains unchanged in our mode of living, which are in the domain of philosophical speculation.

Indeed, these events make philosophical abstraction\neasier with empirical validity, and the philosophical concept of interest, of\nwhich there has been a definite empirical discontinuity, but at the same time\nwithin the chain of the broader philosophical continuity is the Concept of\nexperiencing time.\n\nLike most of us, the initial stages of pandemic living threw me off-balance, and\nin response I sought some refuge in escapist fictional literature; particularly \nThomas Mann’s – The Magic Mountain, which had been glaring at me from the\nbookshelf for two years.\n\nI deem even a brief plot summary to be irrelevant in the scope of this essay,\nfor what I am to discuss deals with a few excerpts from the book discussing the\nnotion of Time and Duration, which provoked my fascination in both applying the\nPhilosophy of Henri Bergson(fn); and being relevant to the state of affairs we\nhave found ourselves in.(fn). \n\nFrom §3 –Mental Gymnastic\n> The protagonist’s temperature is being taken, taking around seven minutes.\n\nA:- ’Seven minutes!

When it seems long to you, then\nit is long; when it seems short, why, then it is short. But how long or how\nshort it actually is, that nobody knows.’\n\nB: – ‘How so? – we do measure it.

Since the present is a point which\nas soon realized becomes past, and we cannot catch the present, we make sense of\ntime via duration aka local memory. Thus there are two ways of preserving the\npast, where one is like a hard-disk, of long term memories, the other is of\nduration, more like RAM, to make sense of the now. As it is obvious, we can’t\nexactly relive a single moment since every moment is uniquely indexed. \n\nEach moment thus contains the possibilities which branch out to the next node,\nan instantaneous creation. A puzzle is posed by Bergson as follows :-\n\n> Can an artist visualize a completed work before it has begun? And if he can,\ndoes that mean that work exists before existing?\n\nSometimes we don’t obviously notice that each moment is unique(apart from time),\nbut a block of solid object is undergoing changes at the molecular level.\n\nA hydra has seven heads, then is it one hydra with seven heads or seven hydras\nwith one body? Where in lies the identity? $$\\[x = \\frac{x}{7} .7\\]$$\n\n\nWe are organisms, not mechanisms.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199747e","created_at":"2020-05-30T15:51:47.000Z","updated_at":"2020-05-30T15:51:47.000Z","published_at":"2020-06-29T07:10:50.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ef993fa5c4714000199749a","uuid":"27b1a7c6-da29-4c61-b5a8-047c403a887b","title":"Sample Page","slug":"sample-page","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"\\n<p>This is an example page.
