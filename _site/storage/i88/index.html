<p>In contrast, practice quality variation is clearly linked to provider effort, an aspect of provider behavior that can be altered through a variety of means.</p>
<p>Health Surveys from around the world provide a snapshot of visits to health care providers for children under the age of 5 for two tracer conditions-acute respiratory infections and diarrhea.</p>
<p>First, their review suggests that the percentage of health care provided by informal providers is consistently high across many countries, accounting for 65-77% of care seeking in Bangladesh, 36-49% in Nigeria, 33% in Kenya, and 55-77% in Thailand.</p>
<p>8 In all these exercises, the working definition of a provider is someone who receives payments for providing 7 The MAQARI project collected data from 19 states in India on summary measures of availability and quality between 2008 and 2011.</p>
<p>With regard to consumer demand, people switch back and forth between public and private providers with some frequency, so from the consumers' perspective, these providers appear to be close substitutes.</p>
<p>The degree of substitutability between public facilities and private providers suggests that quality differentials between these types of providers may not be as large as usually assumed.</p>
<p>Usually, a second interviewer is present to provide answers to questions that the patients may not know, such as the results of a blood test should the provider say he or she would ask for one.</p>
<p>Several vignettes are asked of each provider and are intended to capture the provider's behavior both for cases that should be treated at primary care clinics and for those that should be triaged to higher levels.</p>
<p>Standardized patients provide the most ambitious of the measurement techniques and give the most accurate picture of what providers really do, albeit for a more limited set of cases.</p>
<p>Vignettes really do just measure the provider's knowledge and are an upper bound on the quality of care of which the provider is capable.</p>

<p>Typically providers are given between three and five vignettes, and these include both cases that the provider would be expected to treat in the primary care setting and cases that he or she should be able to identify as serious and triage into higher levels of care.</p>

<p>Providers rarely maintain patient records, particularly in the private sector.</p>
<p>17 Examples include new research on the nonprice determinants of provider behavior through lab-in-the-field measurements of attributes such as altruism, research on the relative performance of the same providers in their public and private clinics using standardized patients, and research that alters the characteristics of standardized patients to examine the sensitivity of antibiotic use to patient characteristics.</p>
<p>In terms of knowledge regarding the correct treatment, Das &amp; Hammer use an independent panel of providers to grade all treatments by the providers in their sample from urban Delhi, the richest state in India.</p>
<p>Preliminary results from this assessment of the availability and quality of health care providers suggest a difference of close to two standard deviations on an aggregate measure of provider competence across Indian states.</p>
<p>The differences across these states are so large that providers with no medical qualifications in the better states are 1-1.5 standard deviations more competent than the fully trained MBBS providers in the worst-performing states.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is that in the two countries for which there are data, roughly half the variation in effort is across providers, and half is within providers.</p>
<p>The variation in effort across providers in India is clearly tied to whether the provider is in the public sector; for instance, among the interactions that lasted less than one minute, most were in the public sector, and time spent in the public sector is 30-50% lower than in the private sector.</p>
<p>Evidence on the extent of under- and overtreatment when providers face real patients requires both that researchers know what the conditions were that the patients presented with and what the providers did with these patients.</p>
<p>The first study based on a representative sample of providers sent standardized patients with three tracer conditions-unstable angina, asthma, and dysentery in a child-to a large sample of providers in rural Madhya Pradesh and urban Delhi.</p>
<p>A persistent question is whether these variations reflect differences in the inputs that providers have access to, such as better equipment or physical infrastructure, or facets of provider behavior that are independent of the inputs that they can use.</p>
<p>If providers did everything that they knew, we would expect a plot of what providers know versus what they do to lie on a 45Â° line.</p>
<p>Focus on the treatment of standardized patients across the same providers in public and private clinics in rural Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>
<p>What providers actually did 100 What providers know 80 60 40 What providers do in private practice 20 What providers do in public practice 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 What providers said they would do Figure 1 The know-do gap in medical care.</p>
<p>Examine several structural explanations for the difference and find little evidence-excess capacity in both public and private clinics rules out optimizing behavior; providers have more equipment in the public clinic; public providers with and without a dual practice behave similarly and on process outcomes; and the differences are identical among the real patient population.</p>
<p>The implied elasticity of improvements in anthropometric outcomes to provider effort is large, and the trial confirms a link among higher provider effort, better process quality measures, and health outcomes.</p>
<p>The intervention bundled community meetings and informal agreements similar to contracts with local public providers with information on these providers.</p>
<p>All experiments led to significant improvements in provider effort measured as adherence to clinical protocols elicited through exit surveys, and in fact, large gains were observed among clinicians by just participating in the experiment, which involved an encouragement visit followed by the presence of the research team at several points to collect data.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the provider who knows what treatment the patient optimally needs but may have incentives to manipulate information in his or her favor by overcharging or by providing unnecessary services, in which unnecessary is defined as those that would not be demanded at their marginal cost should the consumer be fully informed.</p>
<p>The provider knows what procedure is required, and if certain assumptions are met, equal markups to the provider independent of the procedure will lead to the efficient outcome.</p>
<p>Private providers in the bottom third of the competence distribution dispense medicine in the clinic 91% of the time, and this decreases to 74% for the top third; simultaneously, the likelihood of giving a prescription increases from 31% to 68%. We find similar patterns in the rural data, with providers with an MBBS degree almost never dispensing medicine in the clinic.</p>
<p>Conditional on the time spent, providers who complete more of the recommended checklist for each case charge higher prices.</p>
<p>In the urban Indian data from Delhi, the across and within provider price-consultation time gradient is identical for low-quality providers but is small for high-quality providers.</p>
<p>Another piece of the puzzle is provided by results on the total earnings of providers as functions of their characteristics.</p>
<p>College graduate providers earn the same as other college graduates, secondary school-educated providers earn the same as other secondary school graduates, primary school graduates the same as others, and so on.</p>
<p>We do observe a payoff for the doctor to ask those questions as, except for the very top end of the market, the price rewards to effort are identical across and within providers, and most providers operate in a setting with excess capacity.</p>
<p>These include measuring quality; documenting practice quality variation; ruling out structural factors as a major constraint; ruling in provider effort as a critical variable affecting the quality of care and health outcomes that can be altered through a variety of interventions; demonstrating the link between economies of scope and overtreatment; providing evidence on the functioning of the public sector; and documenting the price-quality relationship in unregulated, private markets.</p>
<p>The fundamental question here is, Precisely how sensitive do we want public sector providers to be to patient demand? The argument that the way to improve public provision is by basing payments on consumer demand is equivalent to claiming that the private sector can provide the service more efficiently.</p>
