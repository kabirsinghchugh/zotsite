<p>There are important differences between the concepts, as not all cases of overdiagnosis are medicalizations and not all cases of medicalizations are overdiagnosis.</p>
<p>Medicalization is dealing with sickness while overdiagnosis with disease.</p>
<p>Medicalization is expanding, encompassing the more ''technical'' aspects of overdiagnosis, while overdiagnosis is becoming more ideologized.</p>
<p>With new trends in modern medicine, such as P4 medicine, medicalization will become all-encompassing, while overdiagnosis more or less may dissolve.</p>
<p>The term ''overdiagnosis'' stems from health professionals' reflection on the limits and utility of diagnostics, while ''medicalization'' has its roots in critiques of modern medicine from without, especially from philosophy and the social sciences.</p>
<p>Conceptual medicalizations is when medicalization is a result of using medical taxonomy on new areas, institutional medicalization is when medical doctors become managers without any leadership training, and interactional medicalization, is when medical doctors define social phenomena as disease.</p>
<p>In a societal perspective medicalization has become ''the product as well the cause of societal faith in 123 A wide range of drivers of medicalization have been identified, such as the pharmaceuticalization, biomedicalization, and genetization of society, as well as the drive for human enhancement.</p>
<p>It is propelled by professional interests in Medicalization and overdiagnosis: different but alike Table 1 Examples of definitions of medicalization Type of definition Example of definition Dominance, authority Medicalization is: ''the expansion of medical authority into the domains of everyday existence''(Metzl and Herzig 2007) ''extension of medical authority beyond a legitimate boundary''(Rose 2007) Extended social control: ''On a practical level 'medicalization' refers to the phenomenon that persons tend to adjust their life and life-style according to medical information, advice and procedures.</p>
<p>As already alluded to, the traditional critique of doctors, expanding their empire implied in the medicalization label, has been checked by a myriad of actors and institutions: ''Nowadays, the power of doctors is constrained by the shadow of the law, the apparatus of bioethics, evidence-based medicine, and patients' demands for autonomy to be respected, their rights to health satisfied, their injuries compensated.</p>
<p>'' Accordingly, the ''doctor blaming'' of the early medicalization debate has been replaced by ''patient blaming'' in the 2000s.</p>
<p>The debate has moved on to acknowledge that medicalization is not only an outcome, but a complex process with a wide range of actors.</p>
<p>In a broadening perspective Nicholas Rose argues that medicalization ''has made us the kind of people we are'' in 123 B. Hofmann three dimensions.</p>
<p>As Rose points out, medicalization has become a part of ''making up'' the person: ''It was in part through medicine that the human being became a possible object for positive knowledge-a living individual whose body and mind could be understood by scientific reason.</p>
<p>The original function of the medicalization debate, i.e., using ''medicalization'' as a useful slogan for disputing the legitimacy of medical concerns or identifying the ''extension of medical authority beyond a legitimate boundary'' has lost its relevance.</p>
<p>As Rose points out, medicalization is not useful as a description, as an explanation, or as a critique any longer.</p>
<p>Medicalization has become too diverse and complex; it is driven by a multitude of motives and interests, and it is far from obvious why it is worse to analyze a phenomenon in medical terms than in other terms.</p>
<p>'' In the 1960s and 1970s the medicalization was to gain control and power over something by making it subject to medical professional attention.</p>
<p>As in medicalization, overdiagnosis in a way consists of an expansion of the concept of disease, but the expansion is somewhat different.</p>
<p>As such overdiagnosis shares the ''spookiness'' of medicalization.</p>
<p>In medicalization, non-medical phenomena, say sorrow or sexuality, are given pathological significance.</p>
<p>Accordingly, one can apply the different types of uncertainty suggested by Wynne and argue that overdiagnosis is a matter of uncertainty while medicalization is a matter of indeterminacy.</p>
<p>Overdiagnosis definitely looks like a form of medicalization, but it is different in several ways.</p>
<p>As such the concept of overdiagnosis has been broadened towards more ideological issues while it may be argued that medicalization has lost some of its ideological critique and moved from addressing non-medical to medical phenomena.</p>
<p>Neither medicalization nor overdiagnosis are easy to operationalize.</p>
<p>Overdiagnosis is different from medicalization in that its subject matter is not non-medical, but medical, phenomena.</p>
<p>All things considered, medicalization has become more specified in terms of pharmaceuticalization, genetization, and biomedicalization, and hence more ''technical.</p>
<p>Medicalization has come to include other than experiential non-medical phenomena, and as such becoming all-encompassing, embracing overdiagnosis and ordinary diagnostics.</p>
<p>Investigating one powerful emerging trend that appears to be transformative of medicine as well as the concepts of medicalization and overdiagnosis, P4 medicine, may be a fruitful exercise.</p>
<p>The future of medicalization and overdiagnosis: P4 medicine The recent movement called P4 medicine, based on systems medicine and network theory, represents a self-acclaimed paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Hereby medicalization goes from making ordinary life experiences subject to medical attention to measuring every aspect of life, and thereby making it subject to ''experience,'' attention and control.</p>
<p>The term medicalization may still have a critical function-e.g., to reveal how the conceptual and interpretative control is held by the new ''medics''.</p>
<p>Accordingly, with extensive and continuous monitoring of physiological, immunological, epigenetic, genomic, metabolic, proteomic, mental, and social parameters as suggested in P4 systems medicine, the distinction between medicalization and overdiagnosis is strongly reduced.</p>
<p>Even more, if P4 systems medicine is able to realize its ambitions and destruct the existing disease-focused medicine and to create a paradigmatically new type of wellness medicine then the traditional conception of overdiagnosis will be dissolved and the ideologically fueled conception of overdiagnosis may merge and become a form of medicalization.</p>
<p>The critique of medicalization has traditionally addressed how non-medical phenomena become medical matters, while in overdiagnosis the phenomena raising concern are conditions that are medically identified.</p>
<p>Medicalization is an intended process, while overdiagnosis is an undesired effect.</p>
<p>Despite these traditional differences, medicalization and overdiagnosis are becoming more alike.</p>
<p>Medicalization has Medicalization and overdiagnosis: different but alike moved from expanding the realm of medicine to new territories to using medicine to expand the realm of what is real and enhance significance.</p>
<p>Medicalization is extended beyond non-medical phenomena and new conceptions tend to become comprehensive, also covering overdiagnosis.</p>
<p>While overdiagnosis has been an 'internal' question to medical discourse while medicalization an 'external' one, bringing the medicalized lens to focus on phenomena not previously in its attention, this distinction may become blurred as medicalization and overdiagnosis are broadening concepts that may merge.</p>
<p>In particular, with new trends in modern medicine, such as P4 medicine, medicalization will become all-encompassing, while overdiagnosis more or less may dissolve.</p>
