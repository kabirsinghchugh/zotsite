<p>Direct subsidies to universities may be ineffective in improving the quality of education in the less developed areas.</p>
<p>We focus on universities that operate in economies characterised by the so-called cost sharing funding system where the main sources of university funding are the government allowances, and the students' tuition fees have only a marginal impact on the university resources.</p>
<p>If we consider the case of a circular city with asymmetric costs of moving, we find that the only PBE is characterised by universities setting different levels of quality.</p>
<p>In particular, the universities located in the areas where the moving costs are relatively higher set a lower quality of education.</p>
<p>The presence of moving costs reinforces the monopoly power of universities which prefer to lose part of the potential demand of education and lower the education quality.</p>
<p>In general direct subsidies to universities may be ineffective in improving the quality of education in the less developed areas.</p>
<p>Further, although the degree of competition may be undoubtedly improved by raising the individuals' information about universities' characteristics and students' performance in the labour market, we conclude that the monopoly power of local universities may be regulated more effectively by modifying the structural characteristics and the institutions operating in the regional economies.</p>
<p>1 There exists some evidence on the returns of education that appear to depend on the specific institution attended and on the location of the universities.</p>
<p>The individuals choose to invest in human capital and may incur in moving costs to reach the universities.</p>
<p>In our study we define the quality of education as the set of scientific and technical skills provided by the university that raises the individuals' productivity and we avoid to consider students' facilities.</p>
<p>Where q j [0, q max ], q max &gt; 0, indicates the quality of education supplied by the attended university j; e is the educational level and T represents the firm's technological endowment.</p>
<p>The universities The theoretical framework of this paper considers economies that use a higher education financing method called cost sharing where the main sources of university funding are the government allowances and the students' fees have 3 The same result can be achieved by modelling Bertrand competition in a wage-offer game between firms in the presence of mobility costs.</p>
<p>∂q p ∂q p p ∂q p In this context we assume that each university has the following objective function:    max ju = S C q j X j q j, q− j αq j qj s.t. S C(q j ) 0 X j q j, q− j &gt; 0 where the cost function is increasing in quality, and the demand is a continuous function of the quality q j and of the quality supplied by other universities q− j operating in the whole economy: Cq &gt; 0 ∂Xj &gt;0 ∂q j Cqq 0 ∂Xj &lt; 0.</p>
<p>The impact of students' fees on the total university funding is less than 15% on average consider the issue of competitive pricing and allocative efficiency for higher education.</p>
<p>At t = 2, given the quality choices of the universities, the individuals decide where they want to study and the level of education, considering the distance from the universities.</p>
<p>First, any credible punishment arising from &quot;Nash reversion strategies&quot; in the presence of moving costs always gives rise to positive surplus/profits for universities.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we exclude the possibility that universities may decide to cooperate in setting the quality of education.</p>
<p>We define the Bayesian equilibrium  where the individuals  , , represent the strategies of universities, individuals as the assessment = J , M , f , b(e) where J∗ , M f and firms respectively and b [0, 1] is the firms' belief function, i.e. the probability that a worker with education e is a high ability type derived using the Bayes rule.</p>
<p>Intuitively, Bertrand competition among universities drives education quality at its maximum level.</p>
<p>Since the quality of education is identical in all universities, high ability individuals are indifferent about location.</p>
<p>5, we describe a location of firms and universities when J = 3.</p>
<p>The total cost of acquiring education in university j, for an individual located at a distance d, is c e, θi , q j dτ , where can be thought of as the cost per unit of distance travelled by the individual in going to university j's location.</p>
<p>8 We should notice that without moving costs we lose one of the elements that prevent collusion among universities.</p>
<p>Each university has a demand equal to M and we observe high ability individuals uniformly distributed among universities.</p>
<p>We indicate the area delimited by universities j = 1, and j = 2 as area A1; the area delimited by universities j = 2, and j = 3 as area A2; the area delimited by universities j = 1, and j = 3 as area A3. In particular we assume that individuals located in the area A1 incur in higher moving costs per unit of distance travelled, denoted by , than people located in the area A2 and A3, which have costs indicated by , with &lt; .</p>
<p>As shown in the Appendix, the quality level set by the universities located in the area where individuals face high travelling costs is lower than the quality level set elsewhere.</p>
<p>Moving costs give monopoly power to universities which prefer to lose part of the potential demand of education and lower the education quality.</p>
<p>First of all, we may show that an increase in governmental subsidies S, is more effective in increasing the education quality in universities facing the demand of individuals from lower moving costs area.</p>
<p>∂S ∂S At the same time we show that rising subsidies or changing moving costs may have an impact on quality which depends on the relative size of moving costs and on the margin of profits per student of the universities.</p>
<p>Since &gt; must hold, two scenarios may arise: 2 ξ0 It is always worthwhile reducing the marginal moving cost instead of increasing the direct subsidy to the universities.</p>
<p>Moving costs in these areas generate a sort of stronger monopoly power of universities which prefer to lose part of the potential demand of education and lower the education quality.</p>
<p>Further, although the degree of competition may be undoubtedly improved by raising the individuals' information about universities' characteristics and students' performance in the labour market, we conclude that the monopoly power of local universities may be regulated more effectively by modifying structural characteristics and institutions operating in the regional economies.</p>
<p>Since q j is common knowledge, education acquired in university j is not a signal of individuals' ability.</p>
<p>The universities are located at the same distance from each other along the circle of length J. In this spatial model the universities compete only locally.</p>
<p>Indicating with z˜ the location of an individual who is indifferent between studying in university j or j:   u ·, q j z˜ = u ·, q− j we have:   u ·, q j u ·, q− j 2τ and we can write the demand for universities j as follows:  0 if z˜ &lt; 0 X j q j, q− j = M z˜ if z˜ [0, 1] M if z˜ &gt; 1 z˜ = which implies X j q j, q− j    0 if u ·, q j &lt;  u ·, q− j −  = M z˜ if u ·, qj M if u ·, q j &gt; u ·, q− j .</p>
<p>Indicate with z˜ An , n = 1, 2, 3; the location of an individual located in area An who is indifferent between studying in university j or j, defined as follows: u z˜ A1 = u u z˜ A3 = u u z˜ A2 = u .</p>
<p>Since universities j = 1, and j = 2 are symmetric mutatis mutandis the same scenarios are faced by university j = 2.</p>
<p>Intuitively, the location of an individual who is indifferent between studying in university one and three is z˜ A3 &lt; 1/2 due to quality differences between universities.</p>
<p>In order to choose the low quality university the individual should be located closer to it.</p>
<p>The same holds for z˜ A2. As a consequence, individuals located in the interval and choose to study in the university that is located at the maximum distance where a higher quality is supplied.</p>
