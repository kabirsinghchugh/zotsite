<p>Medical treatment is an example of a credence good: only the physician knows the appropriate treatment, the patient does not.</p>
<p>Information about the type of problem is asymmetric: after examining the patient the physician knows what kind of treatment the patient needs, but the patient does not.</p>
<p>Patients do not only have the possibility to choose the physician they want to interact with but they can also observe by how many other patients a physician has been consulted in the past.</p>
<p>Health care systems also strongly differ by the degree to which patients are allowed to choose their physician: With a general practitioner-centered model, patients are usually assigned to a physician in their district and possibilities to consult different physicians are restricted - in contrast to health care systems with free choice of physician.</p>
<p>These authors analyze data from a natural experiment where a co-payment rate of 10% was introduced for one group of patients but not for a control group of patients.</p>
<p>The material incentives in our experiment are stacked against providing the correct treatment when the patients need a mild treatment, i.e. physicians have strong incentives to overtreat patients.</p>
<p>Reputational incentives to provide proper treatment are weak because the patients cannot unambiguously infer whether they got the treatment they needed or whether they were overtreated.</p>
<p>In contrast, the physicians do know the severity of the patients' problem and the number of patients consulting them.9 The physician then chooses the treatment for the patients who have consulted her.</p>
<p>The reason for assigning the same type of problem to all patients within one group is to make sure that the physician has always the possibility to provide the proper treatment to all consulting patients.</p>
<p>We make the rather plausible assumption that the patient's payoff is lower when his unsolved problem is severe than when it is mild, i.e. v &lt; v. If a patient consults a physician, he will always receive a treatment so that his problem is solved for sure.</p>
<p>Physicians have fixed IDs which are revealed to patients, i.e. physicians are not anonymous to patients.</p>
<p>In essence, the information provided in the history table means that patients can recall their own experiences with a physician but do not know about the experiences of other patients.</p>
<p>To parallel the logic in the field context, it is therefore important that the patient cannot determine ex post whether a severe treatment 11 The reason for informing patients about the severity of their problem is the following: If the patient decides not to consult, he does not receive a treatment and hence his problem is not solved.</p>
<p>Specifically, the additional costs of a severe treatment are socialized in the sense that they are borne by all patients collectively rather than by the overtreated patient alone.</p>
<p>Because patients are informed about how the insurance premium is calculated and learn the premium they have to pay at the end of every period in INS, patients do not only get to know the treatment they received themselves but can also infer the total number of severe treatments within the market from their final payoff.</p>
<p>The physician's payoff for treating one patient is 17 in case of a severe treatment and 10 in case of a mild treatment.</p>
<p>The unique equilibrium in which patients consult the assigned physician and physicians always provide a severe treatment is formally derived in Appendix E. Behaviorally, insurance is expected to increase the consulting rate and the overtreatment rate but not to the level predicted by standard theory.</p>
<p>As a group however, patients would be better off if no patient consulted a physician.</p>
<p>In addition to what patients in treatments without competition see, patients in COMP and INS-COMP also get information about how many patients visited each physician, i.e. the market shares of each physician, but not what treatment the other patients got.</p>
<p>Physicians now have a reputational incentive to provide the required treatment if patients systematically choose to consult the physician with the best odds to have treated the patient correctly.</p>
<p>Patients can now choose physicians with whom other patients apparently have made good experiences.</p>
<p>The physician is informed about the patient's type when deciding on the treatment, so applying backward induction is appropriate to solve the game.</p>
<p>Consulting rate overtreatment rate efficiency rate correct treatment rate average earnings physicians average earnings patients BASE COMP INS INS-COMP 40.7 26.3 61.2 29.6 9.1 6.8 54.7 7.2 70.5 49.7 11.5 7.2 55.3 70.9 71.5 16.2 14.4 5.7 83.1 34.2 89.5 54.9 19.1 6.4 Notes: The table shows averages over all 30 periods and 7 markets in the main treatments.</p>
<p>21 Another limit to the power of reputational incentives is the fact that patients can only recall their own experience with a given physician but not how this physician treated other patients in the market.</p>
<p>A patient can therefore only slowly benefit from other patients' experiences by shunning physicians with a decreasing market share.</p>
<p>21 After 10 interactions with a specific physician, a patient needs to receive a severe treatment in at least 7 out of these interactions in order to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the physician is always providing the appropriate treatment at the 5% level.</p>
<p>Is the share of patients who consult a physician, is the share of consulted physicians who give severe treatment when the problem is mild, where the average is weighted by the number of consultations per session and period.</p>
<p>For a given patient, these expenditures are zero if he does not consult a physician, they are p = 15 if he receives a mild treatment and p = 22 for a severe treatment.</p>
<p>Insurance at the same time also boost expenditures: the first reason is exactly because the patients want to be treated, the second is because physicians overtreat much more knowing that patients do not have to bear the full cost of overtreatment.</p>
<p>The figure shows that inequality of incomes among patients is lowest when patients are covered by medical insurance and much higher in the conditions without insurance.</p>
<p>Concluding remarks We have used the methods of experimental economics to study how competition and insurance shape outcomes in the interaction between patient and physician, with a particular focus on patient overtreatment.</p>
<p>With insurance, more patients consult a physician as the additional cost of treatment is not borne by the consulting patient but by all patients collectively.</p>
<p>The upside of insurance is that it inspires confidence in patients and distributes the cost more evenly among patients.</p>
<p>The downside is that physicians respond to more careless demand for medical treatments by overtreating patients more often.</p>
<p>As a result, efficiency is high and patients are fairly likely to get the treatment they need.</p>
<p>In healthcare systems where physicians receive a fixed premium per patient, patients tend to suffer from undertreatment rather than overtreatment - a phenomenon we abstract from in our experiment.</p>
<p>As physicians always provide the severe treatment in equilibrium, s−i is the total number of severe treatments if patient i does not consult.</p>
<p>A unique equilibrium prevails in which patients consult the assigned physician and physicians provide a severe treatment.</p>
<p>In BASE, 18.3% of all physicians with exactly one consulting patient overtreat that patient.</p>
<p>The overtreatment rate among physicians with two patients consulting in INS is more than twice the rate in INS-COMP, and the overtreatment rate in BASE it is about four times the rate in COMP. The differences are even more pronounced in the cases where a physician has three or more patients consulting.</p>
