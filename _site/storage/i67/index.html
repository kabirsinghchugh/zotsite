<p>116 Journal of Economic Perspectives can alter the operation of markets in fundamental ways; for example, in a market where sellers cannot persuasively communicate to potential buyers information about the quality of a good, low-quality goods will predominate in the market, because sellers are not compensated for offering better-quality goods.</p>
<p>Relatively little attention has yet been paid to how sellers might supply information to mitigate or eliminate adverse selection problems, although sellers of good quality products clearly have a powerful incentive to do so.</p>
<p>Second, the combination of consumer skepticism and the seller's ability to reveal information provides a selective but still powerful incentive for sellers of all but the worst products to acquire and report information.</p>
<p>In many cases, the key problem that arises is not that sellers are unwilling to reveal information, but that sellers can report and reveal information selectively.</p>
<p>One policy response to prevent the selective release of information by sellers would be for the government to mandate disclosure of all of a seller's test results, whether positive or negative.</p>
<p>Even an ignorant buyer can elicit the relevant information by promoting information competition among sellers, thus motivating each to explain why its furnace will work better than competitors' furnaces in the buyer's home.</p>
<p>Self-interested furnace sellers would all omit telling the buyer about possible solutions that might not involve buying a furnace at all, like adding insulation below the roof.</p>
<p>What the Seller Won't Tell You: Persuasion and Disclosure in Markets 119 Skepticism and Unraveling The situations we have described, in which a seller presents information in an attempt to persuade a buyer, can be represented using a class of games called persuasion games.</p>
<p>If there were no legal or other institutions that would penalize a seller for false statements and no incentives provided through repeat purchasing, then the seller's report would be nothing but cheap talk and could hardly influence the buyer.</p>
<p>The first assumption is innocuous: the seller prefers the buyer to choose a higher q-that is, either to buy a higher quantity or to stand ready to pay a higher price.</p>
<p>In our simplest model, we assume that whatever else a seller can do, when the actual quality is ␪, the seller can produce a certification report that proves the actual quality is at least ␪. This assumption would be satisfied, for example, if the seller could always prove the precise quality of its product or if it can prove a tight lower bound on the quality of its product.</p>
<p>If the seller chooses not to prove that the quality exceeds some threshold when the buyer knows that it could do so, then the buyer can react by being extremely cautious in deciding what to purchase, buying only the quantity corresponding to the minimum proven quality.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>After observing the report S, the buyer chooses q to maximize its expected payoff, given its beliefs ␲*S. 3) The buyer's beliefs ␲*S after any report of the quality level S must be consistent with S, because the seller is constrained to be truthful, and must be determined by Bayes' rule whenever that applies.</li>
</ol>
<p>For any quality report S by the seller, the buyer believes that the actual quality of the good is equal to the minimum quality, denoted by m(S), consistent with the seller's report.</p>
<p>The seller's equilibrium report might specify that its quality is exactly i or that the product quality is in some class for which the minimum possible quality is i. Whatever equilibrium report the seller makes, the maximally skeptical buyer draws the same inference and makes the same choice.</p>
<p>The usual presentation first shows that the highest quality sellers always make reports of quality that distinguish their products from all others, and then the remaining sellers face a similar game.</p>
<p>The buyer still casts a skeptical eye on missing information, but the skepticism is muted because the buyer is unsure about what information the seller could have reported.</p>
<p>122 Journal of Economic Perspectives The seller may or may not have a verifiable test report of the score xj on any particular characteristic j. However, the seller always knows the various scores and which characteristics are verifiable.</p>
<p>If the seller makes no report about test j, then the buyer allows both that the seller may not know the value and that the seller may be concealing the value because it is low.</p>
<p>Suppose the buyer expects the seller to run n tests and the seller knows that.</p>
<p>If the seller conducts the n 1st test and its result is positive, the seller can report that favorable result and charge a higher price.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that testing is costly to the seller and cannot increase its average revenues, in equilibrium the seller cannot generally refrain from testing.</p>
<p>First, since the price-setting seller captures the whole surplus from any transaction, the seller prefers testing over no-testing whenever the planner does.</p>
<p>If the test result is good, that allows the seller to charge a higher price; if it is bad, the seller withholds the report and gets the same price as if no test had been run.</p>
<p>In equilibrium, buyers form their beliefs correctly knowing that sellers will engage in these practices, so the seller's manipulations do not lead to systematically higher prices.</p>
<p>In the equilibrium of the persuasion-and-pricing game described here: 1) Prices are set so that the buyer's expected payoff, conditional on the buyer's information, is always zero: that is, the price paid by the buyer is the reservation value based on the quality signal S from the seller.</p>
<p>A buyer who sees no report about a specific characteristic infers, based on the uniform distribution, that the expected value of the unreported characteristic is c. In equilibrium, the seller verifies a quality characteristic when it is greater than 2c. Thus, the buyer is right to infer that the average quality of unverified characteristics is c and the seller is right to infer 126 Journal of Economic Perspectives that it is worth the cost of verifying only when the actual value of the characteristic exceeds 2c. This affirms the intuition that, in equilibrium, the seller reports characteristic j whenever its quality is sufficiently large or the cost of testing is sufficiently low.</p>
<p>A seller of ceiling insulation may fail to report that the product contains a dangerous chemical, such as asbestos, and even a buyer who has a sophisticated understanding of the strategic situation may lack the productspecific knowledge or scientific understanding to know what information to expect, what questions to ask, or what to make of a report that a product does contain a certain chemical.</p>
<p>What is needed in this setting is to hold the seller liable for failures to reveal promptly not only the verifiable information that the seller knew, but also the information that it should have known under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Competition among sellers is sometimes a partial substitute for regulation in this kind of setting, because it can compel sellers to reveal sufficient information to enable buyers to make good decisions.</p>
<p>Even a novice buyer can still be sophisticated-fully aware both of being a novice and of the kinds of strategies that sellers use to mislead novice buyers.</p>
<p>A novice buyer who cannot recognize the name of any characteristics even after the seller reports one will be unable to determine whether the characteristic the seller reports about is the relevant one.6 In a persuasion game with a novice buyer, there is an equilibrium in which sellers always report the test 6 For a formal model of novice buyers, see Milgrom and Roberts.</p>
<p>If we set the more limited objective of having the buyer make the best choice from among the sellers' offerings and if each seller offers only a single product, then sellers with the best offerings will be motivated to point out the characteristics that most distinguish their own products.</p>
<p>Competition can lead to useful disclosures even to novice buyers, provided that they are sophisticated, because sellers will seek to highlight the relative advantages of their products for the particular buyer.</p>
<p>The novice buyer then identifies a characteristic that one of the sellers has named and requests that both sellers report about that characteristic.</p>
<p>7 Proposition 5: Sophisticated novice buyers benefit strongly from competing sellers: 1) If a seller has a better test report for the relevant characteristic than the other seller, then it names the relevant characteristic to the buyer at the first round of the game.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The buyer beliefs are formed as follows: If a seller reports the test result for 7 The other equilibria have the buyer favoring one seller or another, asking about that seller's reported characteristic with a probability greater than 1⁄2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given these values, the sellers engage in price competition, with the winning seller's price set just low enough to attract the buyer and make price reductions unprofitable for the other seller.</p>

<p>Competi- What the Seller Won't Tell You: Persuasion and Disclosure in Markets 131 tion among sellers helps somewhat, because sellers who understand the buyer's needs will be led to emphasize the important characteristics on which their own products have an advantage.</p>
<p>If the best decision for a buyer lies outside the set offered by the sellers, then no seller will have an incentive to reveal this fact.</p>
