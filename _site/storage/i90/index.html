<p>Interestingly, independently of the discount factor, the first-best can always be obtained if it is possible to separate diagnosis and treatment by employing different experts for each task.</p>
<p>In order to do so the contract has to establish equal markup payments, which make the expert indifferent between treatments.</p>
<p>We analyse whether the consumer can choose the payments for treatments in such a way that delegating the choice of treatment to the expert avoids the two-sided incentive problem.</p>
<p>On the one hand, avoiding the former and endowing the expert with efficient information acquisition incentives requires that his reward in the event of failure of the low-cost treatment should be small enough in order to reflect delay cost.</p>
<p>In the event of failure, the expert making the diagnosis can receive a small payment so that information acquisition is induced, while the expert providing the treatment receives a large amount so that total payments to both experts are high enough to give the consumer incentives for truthful reporting.</p>
<p>9 Under a prospective system payments have no link to the real costs of treatments, while under a retrospective system reimbursement is based on real treatment costs.</p>
<p>The standard argument in favour of a prospective payment system is that a fixed budget contains health care costs, because it breaks the link between the expert's income and the number of treatments provided.</p>
<p>Payments for the low-cost treatment should include a reimbursement for a potentially necessary high-cost treatment.</p>
<p>Separation has already been discussed by Darby and Karni as a solution to the problem of fraud by experts, because an expert has only an incentive to recommend unnecessary treatment if he also provides it.</p>
<p>Our model recommends equal markup payments on treatment protocols that are based on the expected costs of a sequence of treatments.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, fraud might then occur when treatments have different markups, as the expert might misrepresent the required treatment.</p>
<p>The limiting case of our model when: the expert's signal is costless as well as perfectly precise; treatments cannot be applied in sequence; and contractual payments are restricted to depend only on the choice of treatment, recovers the setting in Dulleck and Kerschbamer in which their assumptions H, C, and V hold and their Lemma 1 applies.</p>
<p>Treatments are equally costly and experts have no incentive to misrepresent the required treatment, once it is diagnosed.</p>
<p>Without noise the low-cost treatment is less attractive to the expert, because when the treatment fails one can infer that he did not exert diagnostic effort.</p>
<p>14 Since the second treatment is observable, it becomes public that the expert has violated the contract by not acquiring information.</p>
<p>The consumer does not benefit from this punishment if his problem has been solved already by the low-cost treatment, because after a successful treatment he does not gain in utility from an additional treatment.</p>
<p>Under separation of diagnosis and treatment, the first-best can be obtained for all values of d. As we explain in Section 4, the intuition for this efficiency result is that the expert for treatment acts as a budget breaker, in a similar way to the outside party in MacLeod.</p>
<p>Suppose the low-cost treatment has a small and the high-cost treatment a high probability of solving the major problem respectively.</p>
<p>10 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL because the treatment is urgent or the first treatment is irreversible.</p>
<p>Let 2 Z. Then contractually implementing the high-cost treatment without diagnosis is optimal if q  q  and implementing the trial-&amp;-error strategy without diagnosis is optimal if q  q . In comparison with the first-best, the second-best solution involves a higher likelihood of overtreatment for the high-cost treatment and of undertreatment for the the trial-&amp;-error strategy.</p>
<p>Separation of Diagnosis and Treatment Our analysis in the previous Sections implicitly assumes that a single expert is responsible for both diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>27 Suppose the consumer contracts with two different experts, a and b, for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Expert a is an expert for diagnosis and can acquire information about the consumer's problem by investing the effort cost c; expert b incurs the cost T for providing treatment T. After a diagnosis, expert a prescribes a treatment which is then executed by expert b. Otherwise, the sequence of events and the assumptions on observability are the same as explained in Section 1.</p>
<p>A contract specifies the payments: a a p a  ðpHa ; pLS ; pLF Þ; b b p b  ðpHb ; pLS ; pLF Þ; each expert receives, contingent on the first period treatment and the consumer's report about the outcome in case of treatment TL. As before, when the consumer reports failure b of treatment TL , the payment pLF includes expert b's compensation for the additional treatment TH in the second period.</p>
<p>Since the information obtained by diagnosis effort is not publicly observable, under an optimal contract expert a should truthfully reveal the appropriate treatment that expert b has to execute.</p>
<p>The following Lemma characterises the payments p a that make prescribing the appropriate treatment incentive compatible for expert a: L EMMA 2.</p>
<p>Let hold so that the consumer reports success and failure truthfully after treatment TL. Then expert a prescribes TH after observing signal sH , and TL after signal sL , if and only if: 27 We also assume that the two experts are prevented from colluding on information revelation and treatment choice by exchanging side payments.</p>
<p>If expert a selects treatment TH after observing signal s, his payoff is simply pH because this treatment always succeeds.</p>
<p>The first inequality in ensures that choosing TH after sH is optimal and the second inequality that TL is optimal after sL : Intuitively, the expected payments from prescribing the low-cost treatment must be lower than the payments for the high-cost treatment when expert a believes that the latter is appropriate and higher when he thinks the low-cost treatment is correct.</p>
<p>Finally, since expert a is employed as diagnosis expert, the contract has to ensure that he invests the information cost c. By doing so he receives the ex ante expected payoff: a a VIa ðp a  q½rpLS ð1  rÞpHa  ð1  qÞ½rpHa ð1  rÞpLF   c: Note that the difference with VI in is that expert a does not incur any treatment costs, because now expert b performs the treatment.</p>
<p>When not investing in diagnosis, expert a can either get the payoff VHa ðp a by prescribing TH or VTa&amp;E ðp a by the trial-&amp;error strategy, where: VHa ðp a  pHa ; a a VTa&amp;E ðp a  qpLS ð1  qÞpLF : Thus, the effort incentive constraint: VIa ðp a  VHa ðp a Þ; VIa ðp a  VTa&amp;E ðp a Þ; implements diagnosis effort by expert a. As the choice of treatment is verifiable, expert b can be contractually obliged to provide the treatment prescribed by expert a. Therefore, there are no further incentive problems and a treatment based on diagnosis effort is implemented by the payments ðp a ; p b whenever the constraints,, and are satisfied.</p>
<p>24 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL The first inequality in keeps expert a from prescribing treatment TH without prior diagnosis.</p>
<p>The second inequality in ensures that expert a prescribes TH only after observing signal sH. Thus, in our binary setting with two treatments and two signals, the expert's effort constraint keeps him from making fraudulent prescriptions.</p>
<p>Then the first-best outcome can be contractually implemented by separating diagnosis and treatment with the payments for diagnosis: pHa v  TH k a ; a pLS v  TL k a ; a pLF dðv  TH  TL k a ; to expert a, and for treatment: pHb TH k b ; a b pLS TL k b ; b pLF TL dTH ð1  dÞv k b ; b to expert b, where k and k are some constants.</p>
<p>Consider a setting with n treatments Ti and n signals si such that after signal si the expert should prescribe treatment Ti. Then the effort incentive constraints for diagnosis would consist of n inequalities to keep the expert from prescribing one of the n treatments without prior diagnosis.</p>
<p>At the same time, there would be n(n  1) truth-telling constraints to induce the expert after each signal si to prescribe treatment Ti rather than one of the other n  1 treatments.</p>
<p>The intuition for the efficiency result is that there are no incentive problems on the part of expert b, because he is contractually obliged to provide the required treatment.</p>
<p>Our model assumes that treatments are vertically differentiated, because the highcost treatment is equally effective as the low-cost treatment when the consumer's problem is minor but more effective when the problem is major.</p>
<p>There could be economies of scope in provision of diagnosis and treatment or there could be costs reflecting the consumer's time lost by consulting several experts.</p>
<p>Further generalisations of that technology are likely to make it more difficult to implement the first-best when the expert provides both diagnosis and treatment.</p>
