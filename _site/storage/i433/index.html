<p>We investigate whether professional car mechanics - as real sellers of credence goods - react in the same way to changes in informational and institutional constraints.</p>
<p>While we find qualitatively similar effects in the fraud dimensions of undertreatment and overcharging for both subject pools, car mechanics are significantly more prone to supplying unnecessary services in all conditions, which could be a result of decision heuristics they learned in their professional training.</p>
<p>For judging the external validity of student data one way is to compare the behavior of students to that of real professionals in the same environment.</p>
<p>Regarding quantitative differences across subjective pools within a given informational and institutional framework our most important finding is that car mechanics have a more pronounced tendency to supply unnecessary services in each institutional framework, albeit the difference to students is getting smaller across time.</p>
<p>Who compare the behavior of students and managers in a market entry game, finding similar core behavior; and Potters and van Winden who compare the behavior of students and public relationship officers in a lobbying game and only find minor differences.</p>
<p>Burns attributes the difference in behavior between experienced wool buyers and students in a progressive oral auction to the decision rules the former have acquired in the market they know; Fehr and List report CEOs to be more trusting and more trustworthy in an experimental trust game than students are, arguing that CEOs have experienced more often the possible efficiency gains from trust and trustworthiness; Alevy et al.</p>
<p>Attribute the difference in behavior between market professionals from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade and students in an experimental information cascade game to the fact that the former use a more sophisticated decision process and are better able to discern the quality of public signals; and Carpenter and Seki compare the behavior of shrimp fishermen organized in a group that shares both income and operating expenses to that of students in a voluntary contribution game and attribute the finding that the former contribute significantly more to endogenously acquired social preferences.</p>
<p>In total, 96 car mechanics acted as sellers and 96 undergraduate students acted as customers in the computerized experiment using zTree.</p>
<p>At the start of each session, we informed all subjects that there are two roles in the experiment and that car mechanics would exclusively act in one role and students would exclusively act in the other.</p>
<p>We walked car mechanics through the games slowly and explained to them the implications of each possible choice.</p>
<p>We had 3 conditions in the experiment: the baseline condition, the liability condition, and the verifiability condition.</p>
<p>Within a session, we formed independent matching groups of four car mechanics and four students, with random re-matching of one car mechanic and one student after each round within each matching group.</p>
<p>As a comparison to these sessions with car mechanics as experimental sellers of credence goods, we use a subset of the data presented in Dulleck et al.</p>
<p>A few months prior to our experiment with car mechanics, they ran an experiment with an almost identical procedure and the same monetary incentives, using a subject pool consisting of 280 university students, 140 of which were in the role of sellers.</p>
<p>The present study: In the present study all car mechanics were assigned to the role of experts and all students were assigned to the role of consumers, while in Dulleck et al.</p>
<p>Experimental results Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for all experimental treatments, where B, L and V indicate the three experimental conditions introduced above, and subscripts C and S refer to car mechanics and students in the role of sellers.</p>
<p>Comparing two subject pools, we see that the behavior of student consumers is in general comparable whether they are facing student experts or car mechanics.</p>
<p>In both the baseline condition and the verifiability condition the interaction rates are not significantly different from each other, and only in the liability condition the interaction rate of student customers facing car mechanics is significantly lower than that of student customers facing student experts.</p>
<p>More precisely, 4 Throughout the market conditions B, L and V are called 'conditions', while a market condition combined with a specific subject pool is called a 'treatment'.</p>
<p>Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization 108 166-173 171 interaction rates are significantly increased in condition L, but not in condition V. Efficiency is significantly increased in condition L, but not in condition V.5 The insignificant effect of verifiability on interaction - compared to condition B - is driven by two factors.</p>
<p>Experts frequently over- or undertreat even under such vectors: Students provide an inappropriate quality in 17% of the cases under equal-markup vectors, while car mechanics do so in 42% of the cases.</p>
<p>Regardless of the informational and institutional conditions under which transactions take place, car mechanics provide overtreatment much more often than student experts.</p>
<p>Support for R2: In all conditions, car mechanics provide the high quality when the low one is needed significantly more often than students.</p>
<p>In treatment VS we observe such price-vectors in only 2% of all cases, while we observe them in 13% of cases in treatment VC. Thus, in condition V the higher frequency of overtreatment by car mechanics can be explained by their price-posting behavior.</p>
<p>In Table 2 the difference in price-posting behavior in condition V manifests itself in the price spread between high and low quality, which is larger, on average, for car mechanics.</p>
<p>The difference in price-posting behavior between VC and VS might also be responsible for another difference in behavior in condition V: Car mechanics provide the low quality when the high quality is needed in 49% of the relevant cases, while students do so in 60% of the cases.</p>
<p>While the difference between subject pools in posted prices can at least partly explain the difference in under- and overtreatment frequencies between subject pools in condition V it cannot explain the high overtreatment frequency of car mechanics in the other two conditions.</p>
<p>The decreasing tendency of overtreatment ratios is stronger with car mechanics.</p>
<p>Support for R3: Comparing the results of all rounds with those of the last four rounds, in all conditions overtreatment ratios of car mechanics decrease substantially: 0.20 versus 0.05 in the baseline treatment, 0.11 versus 0.03 in the liability treatment, and 0.25 versus 0.07 in the verifiability treatment.</p>
<p>As a result, the overtreatment ratios of car mechanics are, though still higher on average, no longer significantly different from those of student experts when considering only the last four rounds.</p>
<p>As independent variables we use PL , PH , period, and a dummy variable indicating whether the expert was a car mechanic.</p>
<p>As expected from the non-parametric tests, when considering all rounds the car mechanics dummy is positive and highly significant in each condition, confirming that car mechanics are more prone to provide overtreatment than students.</p>
<p>In all conditions overtreatment decreases in PL and this effect is particularly pronounced in condition V. In this latter condition overtreatment also strongly increases in PH. For condition V those price effects are perfectly in line with the material incentives the sellers face, while in conditions B and L they are only inline with the material incentives if sellers intend to charge the price for the quality provided.</p>
<p>Turning to possible explanations for our results, students differ from car mechanics in many dimensions including family background, wealth, education, etc.</p>
<p>More likely, car mechanics' professional training, routines, and norms induce them to use decision heuristics different from those of students.</p>
<p>In the current experiment, car mechanics are introduced to the new, unfamiliar environment of an economic experiment.</p>
<p>In the car repairing business undertreatment often implies serious consequences, either due to institutional constraints or the car mechanic's concern for his reputation.</p>
<p>In the experiment, with experience the car mechanics rely less on their heuristics, as evidenced by the disappearance of differences in overtreatment between car mechanics and students in the last four rounds.</p>
<p>Conclusion We have compared the behavior of university students and car mechanics as sellers in an experimental credence goods market.</p>
<p>Specifically, car mechanics have chosen overtreatment significantly more often than university students in all conditions.</p>
