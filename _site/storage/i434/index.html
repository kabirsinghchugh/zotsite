<p>Precursors of cancer or high-risk disorders should not have the term cancer in them.</p>
<p>Introduction On March 8-9, 2012, the National Cancer Institute convened a meeting to assess the problem of cancer overdiagnosis, which occurs when tumours that would otherwise not become symptomatic are identified and treated.</p>
<p>Benefits of screening, according to cancer type Screening is based on the assumption that cancer has an orderly and gradual progression.</p>
<p>Good survival outcomes for patients with the earliest stages of disease led to the conclusion that detection of cancer at an early stage would dramatically reduce cancer mortality.</p>
<p>2-8 A model of cancer progression that is more suited to the current understanding of cancer biology is one of variable progression, depending on stromal or tumour type, that includes indolent lesions and those that disseminate either early or late.</p>
<p>Removal of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia reduces incidence of cervical cancer, and removal of adenomatous polyps during colonoscopy reduces the incidence of colon cancer.</p>
<p>9 The optimal screening frequency for cervical cancer is 3 years, and for colon cancer generally 5-10 years.</p>
<p>Indolent disease might account for 15-75% of all cancers, depending on organ type.8 Diseasebased screening and diagnostic scans for various purposes have contributed to cancer overdiagnosis, which leads to overtreatment when not recognised, thus reducing the overall eﬀectiveness of screening.</p>
<p>30 Lung cancer Carcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world.</p>
<p>70% of patients with stage I disease survive for 5 years, and 40% of those with stage II cancers.</p>
<p>Lung cancer screening studies and autopsy reports31,32 suggest that a substantial subset of screening-detected cancers are indolent, even in the setting of a cancer type often thought to be aggressive, with 20-25% of cancer detected estimated to be overdiagnosed.</p>
<p>8,33 The National Lung Screening Trial34 reported a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer death with low-dose helical CT screening compared with chest radiograph; however, this finding was seen only in A Biology affects type of progression Indolent lesion Microenvironment Tumour biology Exposures Prostate cancer Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is probably the tumour with the greatest risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>
<p>E236 Personal View high-risk populations assessed at institutions with cancer expertise.</p>
<p>The increase in earlystage disease was substantially greater than the reduction in more advanced cancers20 and results of an analysis suggest that the probability of overdiagnosis for any lung cancer is 18·5% with LDCT, varying on the basis of subtype.</p>
<p>37 Invasive breast cancer Since 1983, the incidence of invasive breast cancer has risen substantially, especially the incidence of cancers with less aggressive characteristics.</p>
<p>48 Risk-based screening should be developed, and recommendations should be based on the type of breast cancer for which women are at risk.47-50 Over time, people might be identified for whom little or no screening is the best strategy, as has been shown in lung cancer.</p>
<p>20 e237 Non-melanotic skin cancers and melanomas About 2·2 million predominantly older Americans are diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancers every year, including basal-cell and squamous-cell cancers.</p>
<p>Many more colon polyps and cervical neoplastic lesions are removed than would progress to colon cancer or cervical cancer.</p>
<p>64,65 Yet incidence of invasive cancer has not dropped concomitantly.</p>
<p>Emerging molecular markers have identified a group of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ whose risk for developing breast cancer is not much higher at 5 years than that of an average woman aged 65 years.</p>
<p>The lowest-grade ductal carcinoma in situ lesions behave more like atypia, with risks for invasive cancer at 10 years in patients with low-grade lesions similar to risks in patients diagnosed with atypia.</p>
<p>The belief in benefits of screening is so pervasive that it prompts recommendations to screen even when consensus is that a test is not of value, as in ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>72 Fear of committing malpractice by not doing enough, the assumption that any disease called cancer will lead to death, and the ingrained cultural response to fight cancer all cloud the ability to recognise when screening or early diagnosis might be creating a problem.</p>
<p>A call for change We attended the March 8-9, 2012, US National Cancer Institute multidisciplinary brainstorming meeting and agreed that it was important for the medical community to recognise that cancer overdiagnosis is an increasingly common problem.</p>
<p>Change cancer terminology The first recommendation was to change cancer terminology-ie, decrease use of the word cancer when it is not appropriate and increase use of the term IDLE. The word cancer should be removed from the names of lesions thought to have a very low likelihood of progression and be replaced with the term IDLE. Currently, pathological descriptions and labels are based on appearance and are a static snapshot of a lesion.</p>
<p>For precancerous lesions, surveillance should be about prediction of the development of an invasive cancer, as well as the time period during which that risk might occur and the type of invasive cancer that might develop.</p>
<p>79 If higher thresholds for risk of invasive cancer are set before a biopsy is recommended, the chance of finding inconsequential disease in both breast and lung cancer screening would be reduced.</p>
<p>Expand our concept of how to approach cancer progression Lastly, we recommended that our concept of how to approach cancer progression should be expanded.</p>
<p>Conclusion In conclusion, we have discussed the harms that are accruing from a one-size-fits-all approach to cancer screening and overuse of the term cancer.</p>
<p>To reduce the substantial harm from this approach and to reduce the overall burden of cancer, the wide range of behaviours and outcomes associated with what is currently called cancer should be recognised.</p>
<p>The approach to cancer screening and treatment can then be tailored accordingly to maximise benefit to the individual patient and the population.</p>

<p>We thank Barnett Kramer, Director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, for his vision and continuing encouragement, and all those who lent their expertise at the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention brainstorming meeting held in March, 2012, to discuss issues related to determining the molecular properties of indolent and aggressive cancers and the challenge of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis; these discussions and conclusions about fruitful future directions in the field form the basis of this Personal View.</p>
