<p>AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS Agricultural Economics 35 183-192 Demand for rural tourism: the effects of quality and information Dimitris Skurasa,∗ , Anastasia Petroua , Gordon Clarkb a Department of Economics, University of Patras, University Campus-Rio, P.O. Box 1391, Patras 26504, Greece b Department of Geography, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YB UK Received 13 October 2004; received in revised form 15 July 2005; accepted 28 September 2005 Abstract The development of rural tourism is regarded as a promising diversification strategy especially for lagging and mountainous areas of the European Union.</p>
<p>Research concerning the demand and/or supply of rural tourism services has been limited within the agricultural economics domain despite the significance attached to rural tourism by various rural development policy measures and initiatives.</p>
<p>In turn, the quality of the tourism experience is the major endogenous factor that positively influences expenditures for rural tourism.</p>
<p>JEL classification: D12, Q18 Keywords: Rural tourism; Composite goods; Agrotourism quality; Information for tourism services; Greece 1.</p>
<p>&quot;New&quot; forms of tourism in rural and regional settings are emerging and are growing almost three times as fast as the classic tourism market c 2006 International Association of Agricultural Economists  2000).</p>
<p>A Eurobarometer survey on &quot;Europeans on Holiday&quot; showed that more and more people are interested not only in &quot;Sampling&quot; new places but also in discovering different forms of tourism, placing greater emphasis on quality products, on more environmentally and culturally sensitive forms of tourism and on shorter but more frequent trips, while a significant number of Europeans choose the countryside as the most preferred tourism destination.</p>
<p>Of course, one should take into account that the traditional forms of tourism are rejuvenating and the &quot;Sun and sand&quot; tourism model shows persistence due to significant restructuring.</p>
<p>The rural tourism market, like all forms of tourism markets and destinations, is both dynamic and erratic.</p>
<p>Although tourists' expenditures and the demand created for tourism in rural areas is acknowledged to be one of the most prominent trends in today's tourism restructuring in Europe, little is known so far about this demand, and empirical economic studies of this kind are very limited.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rural tourism sector is not restricted in the traditional hospitality industry including services of travel agents, hostels, and restaurants but is extended to the food and local products manufacturing industry as well as the agricultural sector because many of the firms that produce rural tourism are, essentially, pluriactive farms.</p>
<p>The study of rural tourism demand, in general, and of consumers' spending behavior in particular, is a good starting point for research in rural tourism economics.</p>
<p>In our modeling of household demand for rural tourism we incorporate the very nature of rural tourism being viewed through a rural development perspective, i.e., tourism is a system of branches or a cluster of different economies rather than a single independent form of economy.</p>
<p>Agricultural Economics 35 183-192 the proposed model facilitates an examination of the effects of different levels of consumer information about the &quot;Tourism experience&quot; that are hypothesized to signal varying levels of quality of the tourism experience commodity.</p>
<p>In the case of rural tourism, the tourists' judgment of satisfying needs is based on the quality of the tourism experience that they consume.</p>
<p>185 The demand for rural tourism services completes a wide range of consumers' needs that go beyond the needs met by conventional &quot;Package&quot; tourism services, such as relaxation, recreation, amenity, and involvement in sports.</p>
<p>Rural tourism developments have relied heavily on cultural re-valorization and re-localization in order to differentiate their tourism service and compete on the fringe of tourism services.</p>
<p>Numerous studies suggest that tourism in rural areas is an extremely diverse sector leading to a wide range of visitors' needs and expectations and high fragmentation.</p>
<p>Consumers, in their search for services that satisfy the aforementioned needs, seek information that goes beyond what is usually asked regarding conventional tourism services.</p>
<p>In tourism, the characteristics of the hospitality industry and especially of the rural tourism establishments, is the most vivid example of a search attribute.</p>
<p>Since consumers cannot judge experience attributes of rural tourism until after they buy and use the product, they always run a risk of purchasing a service that will not satisfy them or that will not increase their utility causing &quot;Damage&quot; to their pocketbooks.</p>
<p>A model of demand for rural tourism A single equation approach to estimating tourism demand is the usual practice in tourism economics research.</p>
<p>Systems of equations models of tourism demand, and especially the AIDS model, have been used to examine the allocation of a tourism expenditure budget between different destinations.</p>
<p>The model presented below, which has been primarily developed in the mainstream agricultural economics domain, acknowledges the heterogeneous nature of the &quot;Tourism experience&quot; service and allows for the examination of the effects of quality as a quantifiable economic indicator.</p>
<p>In our case, the composite service is &quot;The tourism experience&quot; in general, and its physical quantity is the sum of days spent consuming the tourism experience.</p>
<p>If Q G is the quantity of the composite commodity &quot;Tourism experience,&quot; and P G is the corresponding composite commodity price, then: max U s.t. n  PG QG = Y. G=1 Following Eq., the demand function for the composite commodity &quot;Tourism experience&quot; is: D. Skuras et al.</p>
<p>Expenditures on the composite service &quot;Tourism experience&quot; are observed as:    EG = pi xi = PG pi∗ xi = PG pi∗ xi = PG QG. i∈G i∈G i∈G These expenditures refer to aggregate expenditures for elementary services within the composite service such as expenditures for staying at a bed and breakfast for a number of days, or expenditures for food away from home for the same number of days.</p>
<p>The consumer is not interested in days of tourism experience but in days of particular types of tourism experience.</p>
<p>These are only some of the common elements of tourism development in these regions and their only distinct differences concern location in relation to large urban centers and the spatial concentration of tourism development.</p>
<p>We estimated the total expenditures for the tourism experience and the unit value of the tourism experience.</p>
<p>If we consider the whole tourism experience in an area to represent a composite commodity, then its physical quantity may be expressed in days of tourism experience.</p>
<p>The unit value of the tourism service is a central economic indicator of the quality of the purchased rural tourism service.</p>
<p>Agricultural Economics 35 183-192 of information retrieved before rural tourism is consumed also exerts a significant and positive effect on the unit value, indicating that availability of information which provides adequate means of hedging against risk increases the unit value.</p>
<p>Quality of the tourism experience greatly increases expenditures and consequently the exogenous demand for the tourism services of an area.</p>
